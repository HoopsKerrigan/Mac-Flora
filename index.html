	<h3>Day 0 - De-Wintering Ella Mountain</h3>
	<h4>2023.05.19</h4>
	We were finally able to make it up to Ella Mountain today, after concerns about inacessibility due to road washouts from high snowpack.<br>
	I've been floating around the engine crews all week and have been learning some of the ins and outs of their work, but it was nice to finally get up to where I'll be working this summer.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CpHkSjP.jpg" width=90%><br>
	I didn't have too many photos of the view as there were other tasks to be done at the station and this was more of a quick in-and-out to see how the tower was after winter.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2kXHsv4.jpg" width=90%><br>
	Forgive the quality of my phone camera.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oFV4Ci0.jpg" width=45%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ziKqu84.jpg" width=45%><br>
	The windows of the tower were covered by metal shutters that either fold up and out of the way or are fastened to the lower wall.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hg1QxfI.jpg" width=40%><br>
	It was dark and dusty inside before we opened the shutters – all of the linens were taken back to the station for a solid wash.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/66iMGys.jpg" width=90%><br>
	But when all was said and done it brightened up quite nicely. As is the point of the tower, I have a nearly unobscured view of the surrounding landscape for quite a ways, even on hazy days such as today.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gc1JVCK.jpg" width=90%><br>
	In the center of the room is the Osborne Fire Finder, a device used to give direction and distance of a spotted fire. In areas where towers are close enough, these are used to triangulate fires.<br>
	However, this is the sole tower in Nevada, and my use of the Osborne Fire Finder will give others an idea of where to look.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wLHOtyv.jpg" width=90%><br>
	These windows need a heavy application of cleaner, among the other tasks needed to get this tower up to snuff for regular operation.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HXymk69.jpg" width=45%><br><br>
	<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082109058762428426/1109245167157907496/IMG_20230519_134931451_HDR.jpg" width=90%><br>
	Day one at the tower, looking forward to the season!<br><br>

	<h3>Zion National Park, Utah</h3>
	<h4>2023.05.14</h4>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/xaZJbwV.png" width=90%><br>
	Had enough time before my start date in Nevada to make a detour and spend the morning in Zion National Park – a longtime dream of mine. <br>I hadn't even left the park and kept thinking "I have to find a way to come back".<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/UmqzUUd.png" width=90%><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/qkLrFr3.png" width=70%><br>
	I parked outside the park and walked in through the south visitor's center early in the morning Sunday, making sure to get a cancellation on my National Parks passport.<br>I found the "Please do not apply cancellation to your government-issued passport" notice funny.<br><br>

	<h4><u>Watchman Trail</u></h4>
	I started with the Watchman trail, starting right by the visitor's center. The trail is just over 3 miles with over 360 feet of elevation gain and took around two hours to complete, and there were plenty of showy plants to see.<br>
	<br><br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/sA81Azp.png" width=62%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/y8Tn79P.png" width=28%><br>
	Early on you're greeted by banana yucca (<i>Yucca baccata</i>), which remains intermittent throughout the entire trail.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/9IhxNPy.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/IVHu96J.png" width=45%><br>
	You'll also see more blackbrush (<i>Coleogyne ramosissima</i>), this time in bloom! What a difference a move into the canyon can make for bloom time.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/mzv5zNi.png" width=90%><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/F36nyyK.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/mGJuNCv.png" width=45%><br>
	These tall mountain larkspurs (<i>Delphinium scaposum</i>) belong to the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, and were almost missed as I went up the trial.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/krNHMF8.png" width=55%><br>
	Another <i>Castilleja</i>, this one being <i>Castilleja appelgatei</i>, Applegate's paintbrush or wavyleaf paintbrush. From here, the trail goes up.<br><br><br>


	<img src="https://imgur.com/NWsmoF0.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/2h6H2fB.png" width=45%>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/JpD4zQ6.png" width=90%><br>
	Colorado four o'clock (<i>Mirabilis multiflora</i>) giving a nice violet pop as you make your way up.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/AYSQFwE.png" width=35%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/EXSaRb8.png" width=55%><br>
	A new plant to me whose name I adore, roundleaf buffaloberry (<i>Shepherdia rotundifolia</i>). It's weird to see a member of Elaeagnaceae and not have a gut reaction of disgust.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/nmPivS0.png" width=55%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/K63yXbm.png" width=35%><br>
	Here's one that completely surprised me: an ash! Singleleaf ash (<i>Fraxinus anomala</i>) is one of two ash species in Zion valley.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/gvRYcsC.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/F78Yy7P.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/hGE0Lr7.png" width=45%><br>
	Utah penstemon plant (<i>Penstemon utahensis</i>) with a brilliant red ready for any hummingbirds that may be nearby (according to the internet, and as suggested by their tubular flowers).<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/d9umAwY.png" width=90%><br>
	  I was told that this little fellow is a Woodhouse's scrub jay - this shot didn't pick up their vibrant blue colour.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/qfOntUo.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/AnqihQ7.png" width=90%><br>
	I took far too many photos at the end of the trail before turning back and hiking down.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/YrKWVKL.png" width=90%><br>
	On the way down I saw plants I didn't notice on the way up, such as this winding mariposa lily (<i>Calochortus flexuosus</i>).<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/rX7Gl36.png" width=90%><br>
	Or these scouringrush horsetails (<i>Equisetum hymenale</i>)! These were in clusters along an area where a water flow trickles over the trail. I'm always happy to see <i>Equisetum</i>.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/r91L4HL.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/abYFj0k.png" width=45%><br>
	Desert marigold (<i>Baileya multiradiata</i>) catching the sun as it came out from behind the canyon peaks. Zoom in on the stem and note how densley pubescent it is – an adaptation against water loss.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/1CocUID.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/FEHz23y.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/MYIxzFo.png" width=90%><br>
	Walking back to the visitor's center, Fremont cottonwood (<i>Populus fremontii</i>) lines the riverbank.<br><br><br>

	<h4><u>The Zion Shuttle and Going Up the Canyon</u></h4>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/fcrcySP.png" width=28%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/RF41jyP.png" width=62%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/aUjucOT.png" width=90%><br>
	Parking outside and walking into the park was great, as it meant I could hop on Zion's free shuttle to get up and down the canyon to see more.<br>
	Personal cars are prohibited inside the canyon itself, so you get a nice ride through a stunning vista, and the valley itself is quiet given the low traffic.<br><br>
	Given my time constraint to get to Nevada for work (and the fact that I didn't plan ahead at all) meant that I didn't go as far as the Narrows, nor did I apply for an Angel's Landing pass – those will be on my radar for next time.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/7lgxBAR.png" width=90%><br>
	The Court of the Patriarchs was a short but steep walk from shuttle stop 4. From left to right, the peaks are named Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/Q1BFtk9.png" width=28%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/3Whm0d1.png" width=62%><br>
	It was here that I first noticed Gambel oak (<i>Quercus gambelii</i>) as it provided nice shade as the day started to warm up.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ehasRT2.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/BMmy0Gy.png" width=90%><br>
	I'm no geologist but looking at this geologic wonder of a valley, I wish I was one.<br><br><br>

	<h4><u>Weeping Rock</u></h4>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/vtlXdXf.png" width=90%><br>
	Stop 7 brings us to Weeping Rock, a phenomenon that occurs as water percolates through permeable rock, forming a beautiful hanging garden where it drops.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/fRI3ssS.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/6qR3IT4.png" width=65%><br>
	Zion shootingstar (<i>Primula pauciflora var. zionensis</i>) is a very charismatic species that is well known from its presence here. I didn't realize until after I left the park and did some reading that it is relatively short-bloomed, so I'm glad I was able to see it during my detour here. Note the black maidenhair fern (<i>Adiantum capillus</i>) subtending the basal leaves of the Zion shootingstar.<br>There were a decent number of species here that I neglected to photograph.<br><br><br>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ifGtE3Y.png" width=90%><br>
	The wonderful shape of the wall below weeping rock.

	The view from Weeping Rock.<br><br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/rGLUT90.png" width=90%><br><br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/9lUki5m.png" width=90%><br>
	Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i>)! I thought I caught it on the way in but only took a photo on the way out of the Weeping Rock trail.<br>I couldn't get close, but it must be the Rocky Mountain variety based on range.<br><br><br>

	<h3>Trip to Nevada - Arizona and Utah</h3>
	<h4>2023.05.13</h4>
	Had a chance to stop and do a little bit of botanizing on my way out west. Everything up until this point was me looking at plants as I drove down the highway at 70 mph wondering what they were. <br><br>

	<h4><u>Somewhere in Arizona</h4></u>
	First stop was a scenic overlook somewhere in Arizona. Neglected to take any plant photos as I was just happy to be out of the car.
	<img src="https://imgur.com/7YbFAON.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/WrgSk7B.png" width=90%><br><br><br>

	Following that stop was a quick pulloff without a marker, I just really wanted to see what was growing there.<br>It's apparent I drove through at the right time because so much was in bloom.<br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/JBjeuue.png" width=90%><br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/QQH1GlF.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/VjyCZKm.png" width=45%><br>
	Globemallow (<i>Spharalcea parvifolia</i> with brilliant orange that tended to group together on the side of the road.<br><br><br>	

	<img src="https://imgur.com/zFgFidH.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/4UmMKNF.png" width=45%><br>
	Pale evening primose (<i>Oenothera pallida</i>) looking nice with a very funky 4-merous style.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/zEPqW5o.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/B8u8Hpb.png" width=45%><br>
	Rusty lupine (<i>Lupinus pusillus</i>) with a vibrant violet flower and fuzzy legumes.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/NHrdL2R.png" width=90%><br>
	Canaigre dock (<i>Rumex hymenosepalus</i>) in bloom. It reminds me of oakleaf hydrangea blossoms that are past their prime.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/mnlHaal.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/GQIynrr.png" width=45%><br>
	I believe this is desert blazingstar (<i>Mentzelia multiflora</i>). There are several varieties listed but I couldn't hone in on which one.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/FivTQlD.png" width=90%><br>
	My first desert grass ID. This is downy brome (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>), also known as cheatgrass – a horrible invasive that was very common along my route.<br><br><br>


	<h4><u>Glen Canyon Dam</h4></u>
	The next stop was Glen Canyon Dam followed by the Wahweap Overlook. Spent a good hour here enjoying the fresh air and spectacular views.<br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/fjRFgcw.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/m49JZuw.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/PntEVxQ.png" width=45%><br>
	View of the Glen Canyon dam bridge.<br><br><br>	

	<img src="https://imgur.com/kjstEGF.png" width=90%><br>
	Of course there were all sorts of cool-looking plants just out of reach on the other side of this fence.<br><br><br>

	<h4><u>Wahweap Overlook</u></h4>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/iUuHtWl.png" width=90%><br>
	Panorama of the view from the top of the Wahweap Overlook (I recommend opening this image in a new tab and zooming in).<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/IToDY53.png" width=90%><br><br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/6QzsJvm.png" width=90%><br>
	I passed by lots of cholla cactus in New Mexico, but this plains prickly pear (<i>Opuntia polyacantha</i>) was the first cactus I was able to photograph.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/l9XLw3i.jpg" width=45%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0GmkqdN.jpg" width=45%><br>
	I believe this is blackbrush (<i>Coleogyne ramosissima</i>), a scrubby Rosaceace plant. Its blooms were not quite ready to open yet.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/4pa9v9Y.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/36joKyt.png" width=45%><br>
	A brittlebush (<i>Encelia</i> sp.) bloom, exposed on the mountaintop.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/qxwSxva.png" width=90%><br>	
	A pepperweed (<i>Lepidium</i> sp.), a member of the mustard family, on full display.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/EeGQFfG.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/VJvzyD9.png" width=45%><br>
	Some barley (<i>Hordeum</i> sp.) growing right on the edge. It's easy to focus in on the plants but it's also important to put them into their environmental context.<br><br><br>

	<h4><u>Utah Sunset</u></h4>
	<img src=https://imgur.com/ulXgsQs.png" width=90%><br>
	Another panorama, taken off the side of the highway shortly after crossing into Utah. Listening to "Clair de Lune" while driving here as the sun was setting was really cathartic.<br>Once again I recommend opening in a new tab and zooming in.<br><br><br>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/0aDInvT.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/l2uqIBE.png" width=90%><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/sDrdRll.png" width=45%><br>
	Brilliant colour on this prairie-fire (<i>Castilleja</i> sp.), even in the low light of this photo.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ME9WEE9.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/1SJ0kB2.png" width=45%><br>
	I believe this is Thompson's beardtongue (<i>Penstemon thompsoniae</i>). I had nearly missed it but when I became aware of it I realized it was all over the ground!<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ZJBEPnx.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/YXetBYO.png" width=45%><br>
	Desert bitterbrush (<i>Purshia glandulosa</i>) about to pop.<br><br><br>

	Onto woody plants.<br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/FIqDqX7.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ppfdE7j.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/yLoSWfh.png" width=45%><br>
	Piñon pine (<i>Pinus edulis</i>) in person! This charismatic little fella has been on my list for quite some time now. No cones to spot on the branches though.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/CGVIF5t.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Dvx7Enm.png" width=45%><br>
	A juniper (<i>Juniperus</i> sp.) I didn't have time to key out with some funky-looking cones.<br><br><br>

	Overall, a few great stops but I wish I had taken some more time and made more stops in New Mexico and east Arizona. Hopefully I can do so on the way back. <br><br> Next stop, Zion!<br><br>

	Some shots from my time in NCSU's Forestry Summer Camp. Most of the time was spent in the Croatan and Hofmann forests, with some time spent at Cool Springs nearby.<br><br>

	Sassafras is one of my favourite species to see in longleaf pine communities, I'm always sure to pull a leaf to smell.
