<h2>Wheeler Peak</h2>
	<h4>2023.09.10</h4>
	</center>
	I finally had a chance to do the Wheeler Peak hike, just a couple of weeks before the end of my stint in Nevada. I've wanted to do it since I first drove by on the way to Ely for orientation back in May.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9qKNeuo.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	Wheeler Peak is the second highest peak in Nevada, standing at 13,065 feet, behind Boundary Peak at 13,147 feet. However, Boundary Peak is a shoulder summit of Montgomery Peak in California whereas Wheeler Peak is the tallest standalone peak in the state, so take that as you will. Wheeler peak is a prominence of over 7000 feet from the surrounding basin, but the hike starts at an elevation just under 10,000 feet, saving us some legwork.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mh9suAm.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/o2P8kIa.jpg" width=100%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oAmiGjU.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	The hike starts in a lovely grove of aspens (<i>Populus</i> sp., Salicace), and takes you steadily uphill through the grove before breaking into a few sections of grassy meadow. The entire time, Wheeler peak looms sturdily overhead as you make your way up the trail.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7FGcS6N.jpg" width=100%><br><br>

	</center>
	The meadow eventually gives way to steeper, rougher, and rockier hillside at a near 45-degree grade. It is here where grass gives way to blooms, and you can find such lovely plants as the following:<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0SHc82Z.jpg" width=100%><br>
	Mountain monardella (<i>Monardella odoratissima</i>, Lamiaceae), also known as coyote mint.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JkQpp1g.jpg" width=49%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rphu2K3.jpeg" width=49%><br>
	What I believe to be smoothleaf penstemon (<i>Pensetemon leiophyllus</i>, Plantaginaceae).<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2iEk5d7.jpeg" width=100%><br>
	Between the violet blooms popped some kind of rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus</i> sp., Asteraceae) with brilliant yellow.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qhnG1kY.jpg" width=100%><br>
	Some kind of blackberry (<i>Rubus</i> sp., Rosaceae).<br><br>
	</center>
	Such blooms continue throughout the thinning tree cover until you come up to the end of mile three on the trial, where the trees get shorter and more spaced until the treeline ends abruptly at around 11,500 feet - a phenomena I loved to experience.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2iEk5d7.jpeg" width=100%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/64ltY1y.jpeg" width=100%><br>
	What looks to be some kind of cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla</i> sp., Rosaceae). These grew past the other blossoms, right to the treeline.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iZN5TIj.jpg" width=100%><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LdxgfoH.jpg" width=100% title="The last tree!"><br><br>
	</center>
	The last tree! This marked the first occasion on which I walked past the treeline on my own two feet and it was pretty fun to say goodbye to trees for a while. Past the treeline, it's about another mile up to the peak, but the last mile took about as long as the first three. It's like a switch flipped and the elevation starts to affect your stamina, so it's important to take breaks, drink water, and know your limits so as not to put yourself in danger.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KP2Nfq4.jpg" width=100%><br>
	</center>
	A fun plant to see here, way above the treeline, was Parry's primrose (<i>Primula parryi</i>, Primulaceae). This plant can be found along the streams feeding into Lake Teresa and other lakes in the park.<br><br>
	Eventually you reach the top and have a 360-degree view of the surrounding landscape, a truly beautiful spread of the Nevada landscape. Below you, the glacier rests above a grove of Bristlecone pines.<br><br>

	The peak serves as one of the best lunch spots in the state, and it was there that I "enjoyed" a crummy MRE Pizza. Review coming soon.<br><br>

	Wheeler Peak was a challenging and rewarding hike. The challenge is twofold and really picks up in the latter half of your hike, as you have your steepest parts of the trail above the treeline, where you feel the greatest effect of high elevation.<br><br>

	Following this hike, I went back to the grove of bristlecones and romped around, looking for the stump of Prometheus (more on that later). Despite the search being unsuccessful, it was a wonderful day at Great Basin, and of course there were postcards that went out as well.<br><br>

<h2>Winterizing Ella Mountain - Retrospective</h2>
	<h4>2023.09.14</h4>
	<img src="">
	</center>
	Just as quickly as it started, the time has come to winterize Ella Mountain. Four months to the day that I first came to Nevada, I prep to leave and of course there is a mix of emotions. This post doesn't detail anything but is more a personal writeup of my summer on the peak.<br><br>
	I feel so grateful to have been able to spend four months up on Ella, as being a fire lookout is a job that has interested me since I was about 12 years old and is one of the jobs that actually got me interested in natural resources as a career path. To finally have been able to spend a summer up in a tower is a dream come true.

<h2>Prometheus</h2>
	<h4>2023.09.15</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2criQWd.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	The stump of what was once the oldest tree on earth has been on my mind long before I actually came to Nevada, and being so close to Great Basin Park has only increased my interest in finding it. I had done a search for the stump every time I visited, going off of incorrect information from the internet, hopeful searches by satellite, asking park rangers (without answer), and off-trail hiking. None of these methods gave any answer, but as my end date in Nevada drew nearer I began to reach out to different people who may have some authority to disclose the location of the stump of Prometheus.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PJcZZjU.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	Pestering or persistence, whichever you decide to call it, it finally paid off! I was bounced from person to person on the phone over the course of a week (all of whom will remain unnamed) before a lengthy conversation about my intentions, background, expectations, etc. with someone who ended up emailing me the coordinates. The reason for secrecy surrounding the stump's location is the fact that visitors tend to want to take or otherwise vandalize the stump, and the long discussion I had with that last person was mostly for them to gauge whether or not I'd be someone who can be trusted with the location of the stump.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gYKsm6M.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	I have already given the short version of the story of why this is a stump and not a living tree – for a refresher, you can look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(tree)">here</a> or <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grba/planyourvisit/identifying-bristlecone-pines.htm">here</a>. It's a sad one, but I don't personally hold Currey accountable given the fact that a grad student is likely not the one to make a call on whether an ancient tree is cut down.<br><br>
	<u>I will <b>not</b> disclose the location of Prometheus, nor will I give hints to its location – that information is not mine to share.</u> If you'd like to see it, go do some digging and start making some phone calls.<br><br>

	</center>
	My journey to Prometheus started in Caliente –  I decided to add six hours driving (and several hours hiking) to my trip out of Nevada following the end of my season on Ella. I am not too keen on driving but this was worth the extra mileage. If you look closely and with a keen eye, you can see the Ella mountain lookout and radio repeaters on the ridgeline – this was my last view of Ella, taken just before going out of view as I drove north.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IZJYR0p.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	I was told about previous vandalism and removal of parts of the stump in the past, but as soon as I was near the tree I didn't even feel like it was okay to touch it. It's a tree stump, something so mundane and commonplace that it shouldn't be worth it to make a detour for, but the presence that surrounded the stump of Prometheus was palpable. I was surprised to find that the bulk of the tree was still there on the ground where it was felled over 60 years ago – doing some reading later I found that the largest pieces taken were slabs, one of which is in the Great Basin National Park Visitor Center, one is in the Bristlecone Pine Visitor's Center in Ely, NV (where my orientation was held in May), and one is in the possession of the University of Arizona, Tuscon, for study.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9hruCNH.png" width=60%><br>
	Here, I've attempted to map the location of the largest parts of what remains of Prometheus (not to scale/not done with formal measurements).<br><br>
	</center>
	Looking around parts of the tree, you can find marks left from when the tree was cut. The large, flat faces of the cuts are the most stark, but there are also wedges cut from different sections, places where the chainsaw entered but didn't make a complete cut, and even the borehole from the increment borers Currey was using on the tree. The fact that the face of the cut goes directly into a borehole gives some salt to the theory that he got at least one of his increment borers stuck while trying to age it.<br><br>

	I spent about an hour or so by Prometheus, and I think it was just about the perfect send off to the boreal summer. I left Nevada just before the sun started to set, both on the landscape and on this chapter.<br><br>
