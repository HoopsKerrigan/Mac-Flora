	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The latest post can be found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

<h2>Castle Rock Loop</h2>
	<h4>November 12, 2023</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nkSA0kt.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	This post details one of the longest hikes on station: Castle Rock Hike. Without completing any offshoot trails, this hike tops out around 10 miles long and can take up to four hours to complete. It's a great way to spend the day out of town while seeing across parts of Ross Island you don't normally see.<br><br>
	This is a hike for which you need to file an eFoot Plan with the fire station - this is simply a plan that lets them know who you are, who you are with, what hike you plan to do, and your estimated time of return (ETR). If you don't check back in with the firehouse by the time of your ETR, they first give you a phone call and then your contact number. If within five minutes after your ETR you still haven't showed up, the search and rescue (SAR) team is mobilized to try and find you.<br><br>
	The trail starts much the same way as <a href="https://macflora.net/November23.html#Nov230">Hut Ridge Loop</a> and shares the same path out of town. When you come across this sign, you instead continue to the right rather than to the left.<br><br>

	After coming a bit out of the ridge, you find yourself at the foot of an ice field. This field is slightly uphill the whole way and (in early November) as slick as can be and very gusty from down slope winds. There were many instances of sliding on backwards on your feet, pushed by the wind.<br><br>

	Looking backwards towards town (Can you spot <a href="https://macflora.net/October23.html#Oct236">Observation Hill</a>?).</font><br><br>
	</center>
	You may have spotted it in the "Looking forward" photograph above, but there are two small, insulated shelters on the way to Castle Rock known as "apples". These are in place for hikers who get caught when bad weather quickly moves in. The first one (Apple 1, pictured below), is located at the end of the first ice field, roughly halfway between town and Castle Rock itself. It's a good place to take a breather, drink some water, and have a snack.<br><br>
	While you are meant to plan for weather, carry your own extreme cold weather gear, and pack your own food and water for the hike, these apples are also supplied with things like blankets, first aid kits, a fire extinguisher, and toilet paper should you be caught in poor weather and need to shelter in place for a while.<br><br>

	<font size="2">Just outside of Apple 1 looking forward, Castle Rock pokes its head out above the ridge.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Munrzly.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	It's about here that you can look to the northeast and see both LDB Site and Williams Airfield as tiny specks on the ice shelf.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8BtPYp7.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	Castle Rock sits ahead, still dwarfed by Mount Erebus.<br><br></font></center>
	After another stretch on less-treacherous ice than before, you come to the second apple near the base of Castle Rock. This one is slightly larger, being further away from town, but like the first one it is unheated.<br><br>

	Castle Rock does have a trail leading to the top that is guided by ropes to help prevent falls. However, we went too early in the season and as such the rope trail was not set up and the trail was closed. brr.fyi details the trail to the top in the <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/castle-rock-climb">Castle Rock Climb</a> post.<br><br>
	Since the trail to the top was closed, we admired Castle Rock from below and soaked in the Antarctic scenery. It's about here where you really feel like you're on a different planet, as you are well outside of town and can see parts of southwestern Ross Island, which isn't something people working in town see on the regular.<br><br>

	It was just before this shot here on our hike where we noticed the flags had stopped moving almost entirely, and recognized that without wind and being so far away from town it was dead silent. My hiking partner and I stopped and laid down on the trail to soak in the otherworldly silence and got up only because their feet were getting too cold to bear (completely understandable). They're a dear friend and we both agree that soaking in that quiet space remains a top 3 (if not number 1) Antarctic memory.<br><br>

	</center>
	Continuing on, you follow the curve of the trail eastward and down a large slope towards the ice shelf road. It's on this slope where you have to be careful, and sliding down is more advisable than straight walking.<br><br>

	<font size=2">Black flags mark a hazard, immediately to the left and right of the trail.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	After you make it to the ice shelf road, you come across the last shelter, which we dubbed the "alien". It's a Scott Base green dome with a commode inside.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5OT4Rho.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	From there, you're still about three or four miles away from McMurdo, and it's mostly uphill now! You hike on the ice shelf road back onto Ross Island, past Scott Base, and back into town past the fuel tanks (views I evidently don't have photographs of).<br><br>
