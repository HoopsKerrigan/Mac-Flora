	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The latest post can be found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

<h2>Ice Radio – 104.5 FM</h2>
	<h4>October 25, 2023</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5yIMeFV.jpeg" width=80%><br><br>
	</center>
	Within a week of arriving, I completed training to be a host on McMurdo's radio station - Ice Radio 104.5 FM. The station runs for 24 hours a day (running through an automated playlist when not live) and services not only McMurdo station and the surrounding area but also the South Pole.<br><br>
	While all broadcasting infrastructure was supported by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Forces_Network">American Forces Network</a> (AFN - more below) and the broadcasting was overseen by the station broadcast engineer (who also handled the informative and recreational television networks as well as the informative talks), all radio hosting was done by volunteers. Each show was put on by someone sharing their free time with the rest of the community over the airwaves.<br><br>
	For a more personal view of the DJs on Ice Radio from 2022, <a href="https://www.spin.com/2022/01/antarctica-most-remote-radio-station/">SPIN has a good writeup</a> on some of the folks there at the time.<br><br>

	The station has quite the music library in three forms - digital files, compact discs (CDs), and vinyl records. For the bulk of the 2023 summer season, digital files were handled with VLC media player to create playlists. However, shortly after mainbody a switch was made to a different program to handle it all natively.<br><br>

	The entire station was supported by and under the jurisdiction of the American Forces Netowrk, which you may know as the Armed Forces Radio Service or the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS). It's essentially a service provded by the U.S. Military to provide media in a number of overseas locations, including Antarctica. The entire music library (digital and physical) is curated by and subject to review by the AFN, with requests being processed each year when a representative visits the station.<br><br>

	The vinyl library is of interest for a few reasons. It is considered to be one of the most complete AFN vinyl collections on the planet, registering at over 20,000 discs, and that alone is its own neat piece of history. This specific collection also is built up of records that were played by former AFRS disc jockey Adrian Cronauer, who was the real life counterpart of Robin Williams' character in the film <i>Good Morning Vietnam</i>. Lastly, the room had a turntable inside to test records, which means it's a very nice spot to sit and listen to music with good company.<br><br>

	The vinyl library is at a bit of a crossroads, however. While its had a presence on-continent for several decades, there is question of as to whether it remains worthwhile to keep the collection at McMurdo. While everyone I met said it was great that the records were there and available for use, there is debate whether or not they're used enough to justify the cost and space to keep them there. As such, a logbook of room use has been kept for several years to show that it does, in fact, get used regularly. I personally think the collection should stay on the ice (and can't imagine the transport cost of getting all of those records off-continent).<br><br>
	I heard several ideas of where the records would go if they weren't to remain, and the only official one that the broadcast engineer told us was that the Smithsonian Museum was interested in the collection. I'm not sure if this post is a call-to-action for people to contact their local representatives, but I can say from firsthand experience that the record room is frequently used.<br><br>

	My personal show, which I titled "The Bargain Bin", was very freeform and was mostly built upon songs that were stuck in my head throughout the week or that I had been wanting to listen to that particular day. Oftentimes I'd get listeners call in to make a request, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z1Ple-qYuU">which was always fun to do</a>. There were a number of other shows, including but certainly not limited to genre-specific shows (metal, country, electronic, etc.), late-night talk shows, punk music interjected by amateur poetry, call-in dream interpretation, conspiracy theory discussion, and a particularly unhinged show based on finding the most off-the-wall music in the library.<br><br>

	<font size="2">My first playlist.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	If you had a taste for it, I'm sure you could find it, and most shows were once or twice a week (mine was Mondays and Wednesdays from 400 to 530 PM). If no one was broadcasting at a particular time, an randomized playlist was cycled through instead to ensure 24-hour broadcasting.<br><br>
	While my show was all over the place in terms of artist or genre, I always made sure to close it out with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4zA0xnBEJU">Tears for Fears' <i>Everybody Wants to Rule the World</i></a>. To me, it's the perfect closer to the town-hour workday, and I was told more than once that folks would hang back for a few more minutes to listen through.<br><br>
