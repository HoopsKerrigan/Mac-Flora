	<h3>Trip to Nevada - Arizona and Utah</h3>
	<h4>2023.05.13</h4>
	Had a chance to stop and do a little bit of botanizing on my way out west. Everything up until this point was me looking at plants as I drove down the highway at 70 mph wondering what they were. <br><br>

	<h4><u>Somewhere in Arizona</h4></u>
	First stop was a scenic overlook somewhere in Arizona. Neglected to take any plant photos as I was just happy to be out of the car.

	<img src="https://imgur.com/WrgSk7B.png" width=90%><br><br><br>

	Following that stop was a quick pulloff without a marker, I just really wanted to see what was growing there.<br>It's apparent I drove through at the right time because so much was in bloom.<br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/JBjeuue.png" width=90%><br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/QQH1GlF.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/VjyCZKm.png" width=45%><br>
	Globemallow (<i>Spharalcea parvifolia</i> with brilliant orange that tended to group together on the side of the road.<br><br><br>	

	<img src="https://imgur.com/zFgFidH.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/4UmMKNF.png" width=45%><br>
	Pale evening primose (<i>Oenothera pallida</i>) looking nice with a very funky 4-merous style.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/zEPqW5o.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/B8u8Hpb.png" width=45%><br>
	Rusty lupine (<i>Lupinus pusillus</i>) with a vibrant violet flower and fuzzy legumes.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/NHrdL2R.png" width=90%><br>
	Canaigre dock (<i>Rumex hymenosepalus</i>) in bloom. It reminds me of oakleaf hydrangea blossoms that are past their prime.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/mnlHaal.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/GQIynrr.png" width=45%><br>
	I believe this is desert blazingstar (<i>Mentzelia multiflora</i>). There are several varieties listed but I couldn't hone in on which one.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/FivTQlD.png" width=90%><br>
	My first desert grass ID! This is downy brome (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>), also known as cheatgrass.<br><br><br>


	<h4><u>Glen Canyon Dam</h4></u>
	The next stop was Glen Canyon Dam followed by the Wahweap Overlook. Spent a good hour here enjoying the fresh air and spectacular views.<br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/fjRFgcw.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/m49JZuw.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/PntEVxQ.png" width=45%><br>
	View of the Glen Canyon dam bridge.<br><br><br>	

	<img src="https://imgur.com/kjstEGF.png" width=90%><br>
	Of course there were all sorts of cool-looking plants just out of reach on the other side of this fence.<br><br><br>

	<h4><u>Wahweap Overlook</u></h4>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/iUuHtWl.png" width=90%><br>
	Panorama of the view from the top of the Wahweap Overlook (I recommend opening this image in a new tab and zooming in).<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/IToDY53.png" width=90%><br><br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/6QzsJvm.png" width=90%><br>
	I passed by lots of cholla cactus in New Mexico, but this plains prickly pear (<i>Opuntia polyacantha</i>) was the first cactus I was able to photograph.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/l9XLw3i.jpg" width=45%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0GmkqdN.jpg" width=45%><br>
	I believe this is blackbrush (<i>Coleogyne ramosissima</i>), a scrubby Rosaceace plant. Its blooms were not quite ready to open yet.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/4pa9v9Y.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/36joKyt.png" width=45%><br>
	A brittlebush (<i>Encelia</i> sp.) bloom, exposed on the mountaintop.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/qxwSxva.png" width=90%><br>	
	A pepperweed (<i>Lepidium</i> sp.), a member of the mustard family, on full display.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/EeGQFfG.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/VJvzyD9.png" width=45%><br>
	Some barley (<i>Hordeum</i> sp.) growing right on the edge. It's easy to focus in on the plants but it's also important to put them into their environmental context.<br><br><br>

	<h4><u>Utah Sunset</u></h4>
	<img src=https://imgur.com/ulXgsQs.png" width=90%><br>
	Another panorama, taken off the side of the highway shortly after crossing into Utah. Listening to "Clair de Lune" while driving here as the sun was setting was really cathartic.<br>Once again I recommend opening in a new tab and zooming in.<br><br><br>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/0aDInvT.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/l2uqIBE.png" width=90%><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/LUfpEzx.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/sDrdRll.png" width=45%><br>
	Brilliant colour on this prairie-fire (<i>Castilleja</i> sp.), even in the low light of this photo.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ME9WEE9.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/1SJ0kB2.png" width=45%><br>
	I believe this is Thompson's beardtongue (<i>Penstemon thompsoniae</i>). I had nearly missed it but when I became aware of it I realized it was all over the ground!<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ZJBEPnx.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/YXetBYO.png" width=45%><br>
	Desert bitterbrush (<i>Purshia glandulosa</i>) about to pop.<br><br><br>

	Onto woody plants.<br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/FIqDqX7.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ppfdE7j.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/yLoSWfh.png" width=45%><br>
	Piñon pine (<i>Pinus edulis</i>) in person! This charismatic little fella has been on my list for quite some time now. No cones to spot on the branches though.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/CGVIF5t.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Dvx7Enm.png" width=45%><br>
	A juniper (<i>Juniperus</i> sp.) I didn't have time to key out with some funky-looking cones.<br><br><br>

	Overall, a few great stops but I wish I had taken some more time and made more stops in New Mexico and east Arizona. Hopefully I can do so on the way back. <br><br> Next stop, Zion!<br><br>

	<h3>Trip to Nevada - Summer Work</h3>
	<h4>2023.05.09</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T6bt0FL.png" width=90%><br>
	Had to pull over less than 100 miles in - headgasket issue. Officially part of the Subaru Club!
	<br>Towed the car and will be stowing it for the summer. Flew to Texas and borrowed my sister's car to do the rest of the drive.

	Western side of Pilot mountain, a monadnock. This quartzite is over 550 million years old and is the ancient sand deposits from the time of Gondwana and Laurasia. Rock tripe (<i>Umbilicaria</i> sp.) is growing up the cliff face, seen as black texture on the rock.

	<h3>Croatan, Hofmann, and Cool Springs</h3>
	<h4>June 2019</h4>
	Some shots from my time in NCSU's Forestry Summer Camp. Most of the time was spent in the Croatan and Hofmann forests, with some time spent at Cool Springs nearby.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/NUXbhdJ.png" width=90%></br>
	Sassafras is one of my favourite species to see in longleaf pine communities, I'm always sure to pull a leaf to smell.
