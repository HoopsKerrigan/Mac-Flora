	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The latest post can be found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

<h2>Mail Call!</h2>
	<h4>2024.11.20</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hSpb91u.jpeg" width=70%><br><br>
	</center>
	The mail at McMurdo has a very good writeup by brr.fyi – I suggest you <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/mcmurdo-postal-mail">go look at that post</a> for a more detailed breakdown as I'll be going over the most basic and most pertinent details of sending and receiving mail while on the ice. For the most accurate and detailed information on ice mail, refer to the most recent version of the <a href="https://www.usap.gov/travelanddeployment/541/">USAP Participant Guide.</a><br><br>
	The post office is located in Building 140, which also houses shuttles and passenger services/logistics (the people who get you on the plane home). The addresses for McMurdo, Palmer, and Amundsen-Scott stations are all publically available and are located in the USAP Participant Guide. Each post office is handled by the armed forces and as such are listed as <a href="https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm">Army Post Offices (APO)</a>, meaning rates for sending mail to and from these offices are the same as domestic rates. That's correct, you can send a large flat-rate box to Antarctica for the same price as sending it within the United States.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k17d7o7.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	The mail is subject to the same mailing restrictions as regular international packages through the United States Postal Service, as each package is processed through New Zealand. Not only do you need to fill out <a href="https://about.usps.com/forms/ps2976r.pdf">Customs Form 2976-R</a> for the contents of your package, you need to make sure you're not mailing any prohibited items (I referenced the USPS <a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/imm/welcome.htm">International Mail Manual</a> and their <a href=https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/welcome.htm">Publication 52</a> which handles perishables and HAZMAT).<br><br>
	One of the first things I did in the weeks leading up to my deployment to the ice was put together a care package and send it to myself ahead of time. This way, I could save on some luggage weight by shipping things like soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, and snacks down through the mail. Liquids (hot sauces and shampoos) had to be triple-wrapped to prevent breakage as there is no guarantee of climate control for parcels.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OoYoSOp.jpeg" width=80%><br><br>
	</center>
	When mailing flat mail, you simply write the listed address, attach the necessary postage, and mail it as normal. When mailing any packages (and this includes envelopes with anything more than regular correspondance), you must fill out and attach <a href="https://about.usps.com/forms/ps2976r.pdf">Customs Form 2976-R</a> to the parcel. This can be done through services such as <a href="https://cns.usps.com/">USPS Click-N-Ship</a> or <a href="https://www.pirateship.com/">PirateShip</a>, and must be adhered to the package when handing it in to a U.S. Postal Worker. <u>You must go to a post office and hand it in to a postal worker to mail packages to an APO</u>.<br><br>
	When doing so, ensure they copy the address as listed. The postal worker I went to put in <a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28c2_010.htm">APO-AE</a> (Army Post Office - American East) by force of habit since most of APO mail they sent went to Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa – all of which fall under APO-AE. McMurdo and South Pole station are under the realm of APO-AP (Army Post Office - American Pacific).<br><br>
	When the package is out of your hands, it's in the care of the USPS via an <a href="https://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/cs09/CSPO_09_046.htm">International Service Center</a> (I was told McMurdo and Pole mail routes through Chicago) and eventually the United States Air Force (USAF) or New York Air National Guard (NYANG). It is likely that any package you receive will have been opened and inspected by New Zealand Customs (note the tape in the photo below). I was told that there is a customs training facility in Cheech and they like to use incoming Antarctic mail for practice.<br><br>

	En route to its destination in Antarctica, the mail follows a regular flight path from the USA to New Zealand. When in Christchurch, it is processed and held by an APO located right next to the <a href="https://macflora.net/October23.html#Oct231">Clothing Distribution Center (CDC)</a>. From there, tracking becomes unreliable and your package is at the mercy of the flight schedule and how much mail is waiting ahead of yours.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xCvdZXC.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<font size="2">There were at least two instances in 2023-2024 where people wrote to the station as a whole. Thanks Patrick.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	I briefly mentioned the "flight gap" in my post on <a href="https://macflora.net/October23.html#Oct236">Observation Hill</a>. This is the period from late November/early December to mid-to-late February where Phoenix airfield is too soft to handle regular flights and the C17s stop coming down. The C17s are very large planes, and regular flights means packages and freshies galore! However, when they halt operations, the LC-130Hs step up to the plate and handle intercontinental flights to and from Cheech. These planes are much smaller and can only hold so much, so only limited amounts of package mail will make it through on these flights (flat mail is generally able to be squeeezed on most flights).<br><br>
	Pair this fact with the hierarchy of cargo. On any given flight, certain cargos are deemed more important than others. If an essential item is needed on the next flight down, other items (including mail) will get pushed back. From what I recall, the general hierarchy for cargo (not including personnel) goes:<br><br>
	<center>
	Essential Items/Special Cargo > Regular Cargo and Instrumentation > Package Mail (sorted by size)<br><br>
	</center>
	That's right, if you have an egregiously large package, it will be bumped down the list. Freshies fall under "Special Cargo" given their limited shelf life – there were unfortunately times where weather kept planes on the tarmac in Cheech and our much-anticipated freshies sat for an extra few days.<br><br>
	When your package eventually makes it on a plane and down to the ice, it gets unloaded and sorted at Building 140, where they'll let you know if you've received mail. You can check if you have any waiting parcels by looking on the McMurdo Intranet (seeing your name on that long list of people always brought a wave of excitement). I chose this date for my post on mail because, well over two after mailing it to myself, my self-addressed package arrived!<br><br>

	</center>
	Outgoing mail was regular enough during mainbody, but there were often signs posted on community boards detailing mailing deadlines. For things such as holidays or in instances where there would be slight flight gaps (such as between the end of mainbody and shoulder), the post office urged you to get an early jump on outgoing mail.<br><br>

	One last fun thing about the post office was their rubber stamp collection. I always made sure to decorate any postcards or envelopes with some of the art found there.<br><br>

	And all outgoing flatmail received the McMurdo Post Office Stamp as well!<br><br>

	</center>	
	To end this wall of text, I'll just say that receiving mail on station is a <i>huge</i> morale boost, and to walk out of Building 140 holding a postcard, letter, or package always put a big smile on my face. I hope I was able to make you as excited about the postal service as I am. Thank you for reading!<br><br>
