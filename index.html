	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The latest post can be found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

	<h2>High Fire Danger Fireworks</h2>
	<h4>2023.07.04</h4>

	What do you, as a fire station, do when your area of the district finally reaches a Fire Danger Rating of High two days before a holiday known for lighting off pyrotechnics? The answer is to light the fireworks off yourself and be prepared for what fire inevitably starts.<br><br>
	It's a tradition in Caliente for the engines with the BLM to light off fireworks as a way to deter other people from lighting off their own. It makes sense, as people are less likely to purchase their own if they know there's a free display done right in town and this way, the fire crew is A) already present on-site and B) already dressed in full PPE. Rather than having several people light fireworks off in or nearby town, the BLM station bites the bullet and lets people congregate to them.<br><br>

	Here you can see one of our larger engines on the hillside below the launch site.<br><br>
	<img src=https://imgur.com/gTdgoSv.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	And here you can see (blurrily) the fire that started on the hill just below the engine. It was obviously reached and taken care of pretty quickly, and you can see how it pays to be proactive (even if it seems a little backwards) by starting something yourself under your supervision rather than letting some rando start something who knows where.<br><br>

	<h2>Canyons, Both Grand and Narrow</h2>
	<h4>2023.06.27 - 2023.06.28</h4>

	Another set of days off means another chance to romp around these southwestern states. I was hemming and hawing about whether to go to Death Valley or Capitol Reef when I decided at the last minute (as I was walking out the door) to go to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Unfortunately despite being an exploratory trip there aren't as many plants this time around due to me being totally sucked into the landscape of both stops.<br><br>
	From Caliente, the drive is about 4 hours so I took off immediately after work on Monday. The drive was largely uneventful until I hit Arizona highway 89A headed south, where I came across some ominous signage.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/NRTJn8f.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/HkanK5H.png" width=45%><br>
	I was the only one on the road for miles in either direction so I stopped by the side of the road to take it in (as expressed in the following blurry photos).<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/HRDmNPJ.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/vm6QPB9.png" width=45%><br>

	These photos are shaky and blurry due to the nighttime shooting but it was pretty cool to sit and watch for a good twenty minutes, not a single car went by. I'm assuming this was a broadcast burn (which you don't see often out here) but I'm not 100% sure. As I drove back towards Utah-Nevada the next day, I saw lots of Forest Service trucks hanging about the area.<br><br>

	I did the regular move of camping out on public land near the park and driving in very early. I was early enough to get to Point Imperial before the sun was up. At this overlook, I bumped into one ranger and they ended up being the only person I saw for the next three or four hours.<br><br>

	It's always fun to see how things change as you drive them in the daytime - when I drove up it was still pitch black. This is a mix of ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>, Pinaceae), Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>, Pinaceae), and rocky mountain Douglas-firs (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i>, Pinaceae) that were all burned over leaving these snags you see here.<br><br>
	Upon seeing some of the dead trees and the number of retained branches some of these snags had, my friend Jonathan suggested that these aren't "ladder fuels" but rather "elevator fuels". A ladder fuel refers to ways that a fire could spread from the ground to the crown, and certain species actually promote such fire spread. Virginia pine (<i>Pinus virginiana</i>, Pinaceae) back east is an example of a tree that doesn't self-prune (it retains dead branches), and as such you'll have dead branches hanging on that reach from the live crown in the canopy down to the forest floor. These fuels act as ladders for fire to climb vertically. Many trees self-prune, longleaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i>, Pinaceae) being another example within the pine family that drops its dead branches so the living crown above is less likely to catch fire.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/dAXFlnv.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	Here you can see foliage cones for Engelmann spruce. The cones are just a few inches long and with very thin, papery scales. If you look closely at the needles you can see they are almost square-ish, four-sided, or boxy, a trait that can be more readily felt if you roll an individual needle between your fingers.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/64bN7Aw.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	Here you can see the cone for a ponderosa pine, and I show the reverse side of it because you may notice the way the cones form a tiny little saucer where it attaches to the stem. It seems that ponderosa cones really want to open up as wide as they can to get every last seed of their out.<br><br>

	This is Greene's mountain-ash (<i>Sorbus scopulina</i>, Rosaceae), not a true ash! I'm familiar with American mountain-ash (<i>Sorbus americana</i>) in the mountains back east, so this was a welcome surprise. I found this fellow just past peak bloom in an area that had been burned pretty solidly.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/Uytb220.png" width=90%><br>
	I took my time to do the scenic drive in the morning before heading to the visitor's center. The first stop was Roosevelt Point, an overlook with a short (<10 minute) walk with great views.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/FXL9dhc.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/dXCduYy.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/VyAoMNo.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	It was here that you start to see an abundance of desert locust (<i>Robinia neomexicana</i>, Fabaceae). I had noticed tiny, shrubby individuals all the way at Imperial point (picture me hunched over a shrub with a perfect sunrise over one of the natural wonders of the world behind me), but here they grow larger. I don't think I saw too many individuals clear 20 feet tall, and this is likely due to exposure on the ridge and elevation. The next major stop was Cape Royal but I stopped at a few pulloffs to take in the scenery.<br><br>
	<center>

	</center>
	You may be able to see the guardrails in the photo - you can walk across the window to see the canyon from that overlook. Another neat thing is the presence of fir (<i>Abies</i>) and Douglas-fir on the north side of the window. The fact that they are in that shady nook gives them temperatures that are just cool enough and conditions that are just moist enough to allow them to be competitive there.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Rnspp80.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/aCNuksG.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	As you reach the end of the plateau where Angel's Window and Cape Royal sit, you re-enter pi√±on-juniper territory. Walking through here almost felt like a drier shrub pocosin given the low stature of the vegetation. On the right is our old friend pi√±on pine (<i>Pinus edulis</i>, Pinaceae).<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/aRuZLiR.png" width=90%><br>	
	</center>
	Here is a funky one: fernbush (<i>Chamaebatiaria millefolium</i>, Rosaceae). This one has dissected leaves that are reminiscent of some ferns but it is actually in the rose family, which definitely caught me off guard.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Qjf6YoE.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/pHWvJqZ.png" width=90%><br>
	Here is the view from the Angel's Window. You can see the Colorado River in the bottom photo, still grinding away at the canyon walls.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/BB4uWvd.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	It seems that it wouldn't be a proper post without a panorama to view. This is the view from Cape Royal, and it's incredibly difficult to get a sense of scale even when standing there physically. The visitor's center is 12 miles away as the crow files (and over 180 as the car drives), and the canyon is about a mile deep between the two rims. At no point did that click for me and even still I can't fathom that the opposite rim was 12 miles away.<br><br>

	After spending quite a bit of time at Cape Royal, I started making my way back down the scenic drive.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/t5juB7h.png" width=62%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/SjUO29z.png" width=27.55%><br>
	I stopped at the Cliff Spring Trail, which starts in a nice downward hike through ponderosas before you enter a grotto.<br><br>

	I got a kick out of the plants that were growing upside-down. To the right is what I believe to be Utah agave (<i>Agave utahensis</i>, Asparagaceae).<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/jgOXoOb.png" width=90%><br>

	It seems that in cases of extreme fire that destroy the overstory of what is likely ponderosa, Doug-fir, and spruce, quaking aspen is what springs up. You can see in the above photographs that it forms a lush covering over the land (I believe this burn was in the early 2000s. Some of the more recent burns had quaking aspen carpets that were just a couple of feet tall still).<br><br>

	I made my way to the visitor's center for my passport stamp, grabbed a fistful of postcards, and sat down outside the lodge to start writing over a slice of (unfortunately mediocre) pizza. Unfortunately a landslide took out the water main to the north rim so I wasn't able to visit the lodge proper nor did I feel comfortable attempting any inner-canyon hikes due to the concern for heat (it was maybe 80F at the top of the rim but was over 100F in the center of the canyon by midday). So I moseyed around the top of the rim doing the short scenic hikes they did there and then spent some of the afternoon writing postcards to send.<br><br>

	</center>
	It's become tradition at this point, and I'll have more to send out the next time I go someplace. I had a nice chat with the postal clerk at the north rim post office and told them I'd be back to enjoy some more arduous hikes and some food from the lodge when it opens (expected by late July).<br><br>

	<h4>Zion Narrows</h4>
	<h4>2023.06.28</h4>
	</center>
	Planning to spend more time at Grand Canyon's north rim later this summer when things are sorted, I decided to (once again) visit Zion canyon as the Narrows walk had recently opened as water levels were below 150 cubic feet/second.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/nMzmYFx.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ucl5da7.png" width=27.55%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/3gj9mDm.png" width=62%><br>
	</center>
	As I decided to walk the Narrows at the last minute on a whim, I rented the gear from a rental shop near Zion park and picked it up the night before to be ready to go in the morning. After getting that sorted and before another night of car camping, I had more pizza (which was better than the Grand Canyon slice and other slices I've had in/around Zion).<br><br>
	Had I prepped beforehand and did some reading, I would have likely purchased my own pair of water shoes to use for the hike. Altogether, the shoes, stick, and bag cost $50 which isn't a small chunk of change but is pretty solid for a one-off rental. Me being so near Zion and having it as an option to visit on days off could very well warrant a purchase of water shoes for that same price or a little more should I want to do the Narrows again. Something to consider if you want to do this hike. I would NOT do this hike barefoot - you definitely need something with traction and ankle support given the conditions of the hike. For many parts of the walk, your ankles are taking the full force of oncoming water and I definitely felt how sore they were when I finished.<br><br>

	The Narrows starts at the end of the Riverside walk, a 1-mile paved walkway along the Virgin River that starts at the Temple of Sinawava at the northern part of Zion Canyon. I've shared photos of the riverside walk (and much of the canyon itself) so I won't bombard you here. I did spot sacred datura (<i>Datura wrightii</i>, Solanaceae), a relative of potato and tomato in the nightshade family. I've been on the lookout for this plant since coming out here in May and started seeing it sometime in June, but have held off on sharing it as I think it deserves its own writeup.<br><br>
	It's an absolutely fascinating and alluring plant with a very cool history, and the plant itself is incredibly toxic and has been used as a deliriant/hallucinogen. It's hard to argue against its beauty, and in the back of my mind I tell myself that this flower belongs to the moon given its appearance and its incredibly ephemeral habit. I'll have more on it in the future.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/7HbCQnf.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	This photo is taken of some water flow over a sheer wall, early in the walk (maybe ¬Ω mile from the start of the Narrows). I took it after what the first major "filter" in the trail is; to reach where I was standing when the photo was taken, you have to go navel-deep in water that was more than a little chilly in the morning. It's understandable why many turn back here, but I was ready for anything and planned to take the whole day just for this hike.<br><br>
	I'm going to try and just share the photos in the order taken so you can see some of the sights without too much interruption. There are some cool geology and plants to discuss so I'll chime in but for most of this hike I was just in awe of my surroundings.<br><br>

	Look at the person in the above photo to get a sense of scale. If you can't see them, I urge you to zoom in. In many places of the Narrows, the walls on either side of you stretch up over 1,000 feet. <i>Nuts</i>.<br><br>
	I believe much of this stretch where you're really in the canyon is called Wall Street.<br><br>

	One last rant on cairns to try and properly articulate it in a way I don't think I fully mentioned last time. I mentioned that lots of little creatures like to hang out underneath rocks in both wet and dry environments. Here, near a riverbed, it may be more intuitive that things would want to hide underneath rocks where it's wet and sheltered. However, in drier places like Bryce Canyon or drier, people may wonder what the big deal is if seemingly nothing is there to use the rock.<br><br>
	A cairn is something meant to be seen and they do have their uses, especially in marking trail. A lot of the places you'll find them in parks such as Zion are along well-established and even paved trails, so they're more for fun or for show than for any utility. What a cairn is in that case is a visual indicator that someone came along and did something to the landscape. Yes, national parks are <u>very</u> manicured experiences of some of what the U.S. has to offer, but it's still an experience in nature. If one person builds a cairn, to how many people that pass are they signaling that it's okay to mess around with what's there?<br><br>
	More importantly, it could cause someone to think that messing around is not only okay in this park but in others, and someone who sees a cairn in Death Valley may go to the Great Smoky Mountains and start changing rivers there where <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/amphibians.htm">the waters are very much used by critters</a>.<br><br>
	I am all for manipulating the land (I have a background in forestry for Pete's sake), but it's important to do so in an informed way that largely benefits the landscape as a whole. In the U.S. we've been manipulating the land in a way that's detrimental for a very long time, and I'm glad to understand that things have turned around over the past half century. There are right and wrong ways to interact with the landscape, and stacking rocks ain't it. There's a reason you can't take materials out of national parks and why there is so much stress on the lines "Take nothing but photos, leave nothing but footprints, kill nothing but time". End rant.<br><br>

	Here we see what (I think) is an excellent example of the geologic process of cross-bedding. It is my understanding that the direction of grain you see are ancient sand dunes that compressed into the stone you see here today, carved out by the Virgin river over millions of years.<br><br>

	Here is a cool little spot a few miles into the trail where there is a hanging garden! All on top you can see maidenhair fern (<i>Adiantum capillus-veneris</i>, Pteridaceae) as well as bracken fern (<i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>, Dennstaedtiaceae).<br><br>
	It was as I was getting closer to this hanging garden to take closer photographs where I realized the water got deep, and very quickly. No photos yet but I was up to my neck in water with my bag held above my head wondering if it was going to shallow out again. It just so happens that this is about where the hike went from Type I Fun to Type II Fun.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/nUKqWsO.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	I took this standing on a rock right after the neck-deep water. Given the abruptness of the depth increase and the temperature of the water, I was seriously considering just turning back as I sat atop the boulder for a good 15 minutes while soaking wet. After sitting, I decided I was already wet and kept going forward.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/nLfbjaV.png" width=27.55%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/YGFqyYV.png" width=62%><br>
	After yet another section of neck-deep water (edging from Type II to Type III Fun...), you finally come back out into the sun as the canyon walls get wider.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Ta5pjUA.png" width=90%><br>
	More crossbedding!<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/LXJ4PRc.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	It was still only around 1100 AM so I decided to try and dry my clothes as best as I could as I basked in the sun for about an hour. After my things were mostly dry, I kept going forward and told myself I'd turn around the next time the water went up to my belt buckle.<br><br>

	Along the way there was our old pal scouring rush (<i>Equisetum hyemale</i>, Equisetaceae), maidenhair fern, and bracken fern.<br><br>

	As well as some more western columbine (<i>Aquilegia chrysantha</i>, Ranunculaceae).<br><br>

	And a new one from a familiar family, American spikenard (<i>Aralia bicrenata</i>, Araliaceae). This one was not quite in bloom but the flowers were on their way.<br><br>

	My journey was stopped when I reached what I believe to be the Boulder Pair, seen above (images online don't show these rocks themselves but another set of boulders much earlier in the hike. I don't think the online images are correct given the location when compared to trail maps - that or there are multiple sets that people refer to as the boulder pair).<br><br>
	You can't readily climb over or go through the pair here and to the right there was deeper water, so I turned around. I was four hours and likely under 5 miles into the hike and while I didn't quite make it to Big Springs (maybe another half hour, and when you get there you're turned around from going further), I felt I had gotten a lot out of this hike. I know I'll be back to do the full trip up to Big Springs but by this point I figured if I was going to get soaking wet again, I might as well be on the return trip.<br><br>
	I should also note that I hadn't seen any other hikers after I stopped to dry off - the part where it gets to your neck seems to be another big filter for hikers and I don't blame anyone for turning back there. I'm quite tall and was up to my neck, and can't imagine what a shorter hiker would feel trying to pass some of those areas. It would however be interesting to see statistics on just how far most hikers go before turning back.<br><br>

	One last image of the Narrows. On the way out I stopped and had someone take my photo of the first deep section near the hanging garden rock. By this point I was reveling in it (given I had my now-dry shirt and sweatshirt in my bag, ready to change into), and we were well back into Type I Fun. On my hike back I bumped into a hiker and we chatted the whole way to the shuttle stop and then to the Lodge where I stopped for some more postcards and a bowl of soup. Grant, if you're reading this, hello!<br><br>

	Yet another cancellation for the passport and I was headed back towards Nevada.<br><br>
