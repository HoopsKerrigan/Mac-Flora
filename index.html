<h2>The Nevada Monsoon Season</h2>
	<h4>2023.07.20</h4>
	</center>
	Heading into the latter half of July, we've entered the start of the monsoon season here in Nevada. Earlier in the season, there had been some remnant showers and rare thunderstorms but it was still too wet for fires to start in any significant capacity. However, more than a month has passed since the last bout of rain and fuels here have dried considerably. The southern part of Ely district has gone from low fire danger to moderate over the course of a couple of months, and then from moderate to extreme over just a week and a half.<br><br>

	The panorama above shows significant cloud buildup and some showers - a drastic difference to the clear skies we had been having for the past month. Here I am last week marvelling at the presence of a tiny cloud – what feels like the first one since mid-to-late June.<br><br>

	A typical monsoon season for southern Nevada has systems that move from the southwest to the northeast as warm, moist air over the Pacific ocean is carried inland. As it meanders just south of the Sierra Nevada range, it carries storms as it makes its way across California, Mexico, southern Nevada, and Arizona. These storms are expected each year and bring lightning, having a tendency to cause fires. Generally, a high pressure system over the four corners area drives that southwest-to-northeast flow of air typical for the late summers here.<br><br>
	If there is anything I've garnered is that 2023 has been an unusual weather year compared to past years. <a href="https://www.weather.gov/psr/2022MonsoonReview">2022 was the wettest monsoon season since 2006</a>, and rains from last summer (in addition to heavy snowfall this winter) fostered widespread growth of grasses and wetter live fuels into this summer. Earlier this season, temperatures were recorded as lower than normal (with some nights in June dipping below 40 in the tower) resulting in a slow start to the fire season.<br><br>

	With the onset of the monsoons finally starting, even their arrival is different than usual. They seem to be coming from a more westerly direction and are farther north than in previous years (note: this is anecdotally from my supervisors but their movement is observable from the tower and I trust their experience in the district). Even just this afternoon, I noted systems building up in the east that crept westward towards the tower – an area I'll have to keep a close eye on in the morning so as to not miss any potential blow ups.<br><br>
	So what has this resulted in? Monday was the first day of the rains, and strikes from that evening resulted in at least four fires in the far northern part of the district, near Ely. Tuesday's lightning display brought an additional two fires, again near Ely. Wednesday night's lightning brought one more fire that was taken care of by the late evening today (Thursday).<br><br>
	You may be able to see the pattern here – clouds generally buildup in the later afternoon when temperatures are warmest, then strikes persist through the evening and night. In current conditions, fires will smolder overnight when humidity is higher and temperatures cooler, until the sun comes up and increases temperatures and reduces humidity, allowing them to increase in activity. I am keeping my eyes out for clouds that look like the one below. The white, puffy clouds look nice but the first sign of buildup is a red flag that it will begin towering into a thunderhead.<br><br>

	In addition to keeping eyes up both day and now night (until bedtime), there are some additional resources I can use to get an idea of where to look. The tool at <a href="https://www.lightningmaps.org/#m=oss;t=3;s=0;o=0;b=;ts=0;y=37.3068;x=-114.2777;z=10;d=2;dl=2;dc=0;">LightningMaps.org</a> is a near-realtime look at lightning strikes with a high degree of accuracy (and it even shows the radius of the soundwave generated by the strike). Below is a map showing what those strikes look like (the triangle is Ella Mountain). This was Wednesday night, the 19th.<br><br>

	For a more familiar view, the Bureau of Land Management has many cameras across the west that are used in spotting fires. These cameras are typically placed in conjunction with radio repeaters as they are usually in high areas with great sightlines. The Ella Mountain repeater has two cameras that you can view up to 12 hours in the past – one facing <a href="https://www.alertwildfire.org/region/blmnv/?camera=Axis-EllaMtn1">west</a> and one facing <a href="https://www.alertwildfire.org/region/blmnv/?camera=Axis-EllaMtn2">south</a>, and you can poke around that website to find other cameras in the Ely district and Nevada as a whole.<br><br>
	I tend to keep the lightning map open now that clouds are making a comeback here in Lincoln County, but I don't tend to keep a close eye on the cameras. If I need to see how cloud cover has changed over time they make a great resource, but otherwise their viewing range is about the same as what I can see (and even less so when you factor in binoculars).<br><br>
	The lightning display from these monsoons are phenomenal, and it is absolutely surreal to view lightning strikes from so far away. The bulk of last night's storms were between 25 and 40 miles north of me, meaning I was too far to even hear any thunder from them (as thunder has a general maximum of about <a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-science-thunder">10 miles travel</a>). That said, there were a few rogue strikes that were within a mile of the tower to the southwest – those absolutely scared the wits out of me as my eyes were looking northward and all of a sudden you feel the force of the thunder.<br><br>

	For an attempt at a sense of scale, Chief Mountain (that two-peaked mountain in the foreground of the above shots) is about 20 miles from Ella Mountain and has a prominence of 1700-2000 feet above the rest of the surrounding valley. I think the second and the last photos show the size of these storms and their lightning strikes the best.<br><br>
	Apologies for any smearing in these shots – I don't have a camera tripod and have been meaning to pick one up soon. I'll be in St. George for a dentist appointment next week and intend to pick one up then. With that, I'll be able to take better photos of the night sky.<br><br>
