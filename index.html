	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The three latest posts are found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

	<h3>Let's Talk About Spinning Weather</h3>
	<h4>2023.06.26</h4>

	One of my duties up in the tower is to spin weather at 1:00 PM every day I'm in service. This started as a result of 1:00 PM being the time for an afternoon check in, and I felt it would be good to have something prepared to read back to dispatch when they call in. Lately, the weather has been pretty consistent (getting warmer and drier), but I've seen a pretty wide spectrum already in my time here.<br><br>
	Since the driving winds are generally from the south and I'm usually the southernmost employee in the district while at the tower, this afternoon weather reading is a way for dispatch all the way in Ely (northern end of the district) to get an idea of what conditions are like in the south. Of course, being at such a high elevation (7400 feet) means these readings should be taken with a grain of salt as the readings are generally of cooler temperatures, higher winds (due to being on the ridgetop), and greater humidity.<br><br>
	This reading comes in tandem with weather reports put out twice daily by the National Weather Service. You can see the Fire Weather Forecast for Lincoln County, Nevada <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=VEF&issuedby=VEF&product=AFD&format=txt&version=1&glossary=1">here</a>. To find such a report for your area, seach "(Location) Area Forecast Discussion. These readings are given by dispatch every day at 1030 AM and 330 PM.<br><br>

	To determine current weather conditions, I use what's called a belt weather kit. This is a tool developed to be portable but also give imporant weather metrics such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction in a relatively short amount of time.<br><br>

	Here is everything laid out on the table, you can see that it has everything you need to read weather. From left to right you have the writing board and notebook, two relative humidity slides, a bottle of distilled water, a sling psychrometer, two wind meters, and two pencils.<br><br>

	I don't use the provided notebook because I do one reading a day, and there was an extra spiral notebook at the tower I felt was good to use. The provided notebook is more for repeated readings in the same area, such as when you're on a fire and need more local and regular weather readings. Such readings would allow you to track change over time over the course of your shift - is it getting drier? Are winds picking up? Etc.<br><br>

	</center>The sling psychrometer is a tool that allows you to estimate relative humidity based on the differences in temperature between a wet and dry bulb on two separate thermometers. You take this apparatus, spin it, check the difference in temperature, and compare to a table where the math has been worked out for you to determine relative humidity and dew point.<br><br>

	This is an anemometer and works in a clever way. In the center tube between two scales (indicating wind speed) is a small ball. This device is held into the wind, allowing the wind to enter through two holes on the rear of the body. This wind then pushes the ball up to give you your wind reading. To change between the readings on the left and right side, you simply hold your finger over the red opening on top to increase the amount of force it takes to lift the ball.<br><br>

	Here is one such table, for readings between 6101 and 8500 feet of elevation (assuming 23" of mercury on a barometer). There are a number of tables in this printout that are meant to be used at different elevations or pressures. For any given pressure, there are relative humidity and dew point estimates for a large range of temperatures from less than freezing to well above 100 degrees.<br><br>

	To read your weather, it's important to find a spot representative of the area you're reading for. An unobscured spot <b>into the wind</b> is ideal, and not too close to any fire (so as not to have the readings influenced by those local conditions). You're looking for an ambient reading of your area. The southern side of the tower works for most days, as the wind usually comes from the south or southwest.<br><br>
	Read the two thermometers before you start to get an idea of where they're starting (they should be the same temperature). You wet the bulb of your wet bulb thermometer (wrapped in cotton) and start spinning immediately, making sure to spin for a full minute. I usually hold the anemometer in my other hand while I spin to read wind speed while spinning.<br><br>

	Here is a sling psychrometer in use, being spun by my old friend Hank.<br><br>
	</center>
	After one minute, you read your thermometers to see the difference. The wet bulb should read a cooler temperature than the dry bulb due to evaporative cooling, and the psychrometer allows you to estimate relative humidity based on this fact. The lower the relative humidity, the more water that evaporates, and the greater the difference in temperatures between the two thermometers.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/QQxi3Sg.png" width=45%><br>
	Here are the readings after one minute, with the dry bulb at 73F and the wet bulb at 47F.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/mmmk8nx.png" width=45%><br>
	After two minutes, dry 70F and wet 47F.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ggCtfj8.png" width=45%><br>
	And after three minutes, dry 70F and wet 47F.<br><br>
	You can see that the readings have stabilized between minutes two and three, which is what we're looking for. If the temperatures hadn't stabilized, we would spin again until they did.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/p7Cjjxl.png" width=55%><br>
	To estimate the relative humidity, you use the tables or the provided slide to get a readout.<br><br>
	Above are such a slide, where we align 47F on the wet bulb to 70F on the dry bulb, giving a relative humidity of 12% (highlighted in the bottom photo).<br><br>

	Use your eyes and best judgement to determine visibility and sky conditions to give a good readout. Today, it was sunny/clear skies with good visibility. I determine visibility based on what peaks I can see and with what clarity. Today, visibility was good.<br><br>

	And then you write it down and wait for dispatch to call in for the reading. Above is today's weather report.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/vknHHNJ.png" width=45%><br>
	If all of that seems like too much of a hassle, you can always pick up a Kestrel handheld weather reader to do all that and more for you at the push of a button.<br><br>
