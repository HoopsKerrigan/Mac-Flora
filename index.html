	<h3>Wildflowers of a Nevada-Utah Highway</h3>
	<h4>2023.05.20</h4>
	Had to drive back towards Utah to a spot with phone signal to do 2FA to sign some documents, and on the way back I stopped at every turnoff to see what was in bloom.<br><br>
	<img src ="https://imgur.com/y8y7gGC.png" width=90%><br>
	I had originally stopped before the Nevada-Utah border but was chased back into the car due to thunderstorms and hail, so all of these photos were taken on Highway 319 in Nevada.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/7K5YG2V.png" width=90%><br>
	The first stop is between the road and continuous piñon-juniper woodlands. It is in these ares where wildflowers and shrubs thrive, though I'm not sure if it's management or burn scar that lets them do so.<br><br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Kj5DhMp.png" width=90%><br>
	I have some reading to do but will get into piñon-juniper in Nevada soon.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/7A7DtRI.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ihYzIDE.png" width=45%><br>
	We start with what I believe to be cushion phlox (<i>Phlox pulvinata</i>), which grows very readily along the side of the highway. As the name suggests, they form these cushions of blooms.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/EOu9cPG.png" width=90%><br>
	What looks like broadbeard beardtongue (<i>Penstemon angustifolius</i> - another penstemon), but not yet in bloom. This should bear bright blue blooms before too long.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/axA8pIj.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/WBihP3x.png" width=45%><br>
	For these I was directed to spring forget-me-not (<i>Myosotis verna</i>), but the leaves on this look a little narrow compared to images online.<br><br><br> 

	<img src="https://imgur.com/AP5lsXK.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/eOx6evo.png" width=45%><br>
	A pre-bloom lotus milkvetch(<i>Astragalus lotiflorus</i>). These blossoms will range from white to pink to violet when they open.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/pMnF9Qs.png" width=90%><br>
	There were a few plains pricklypear hanging about the blossoms here.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/KhEyDku.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/FoVn3QG.png" width=45%><br>
	These flowers were uniquitous at this stop, and were found amongst other plants. It is definitely <i>Cryptantha</i> sp., possibly/likely weakstem cryptantha (<i>Cryptantha flaccida</i>) based on range.<br>
	The genus <i>Cryptantha</i> comes from the Greek "kryptos" meaning "to hide" and "anthos" meaning "flower". Apparently in other species the flowers can be hidden by bracts that subtend the blossoms.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/X26vm40.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/nFQ2YqL.png" width=45%><br>
	Russian thistle, also known as tumbleweed and <i>better</i> known as windwitch (currently classified as <i>Kali tragus</i>), is a noxious invasive from Euraisa that has plagued the USDA since the 1800s.<br>
	As the common name suggests, this weed tumbles and in doing so, spreads seed across the landscape. This plant probably deserves a full writeup given its life cycle and history in the US.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/5bwBwKB.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/uFYlfY8.png" width=45%><br>
	Chambers' twinpod (<i>Physaria chambersii</i>), a member of the mustard family Brassicaceae, displaying a brilliant yellow bloom. Check out the glaucousness of those leaves, another water-saving trait.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ZONMvo8.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/5Def1fY.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/1n3dp3w.png" width=62%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/V4P5SkT.png" width=28%><br>
	I became enamoured with this little fellow - mat buckwheat (<i>Eriogonum caespitosum</i>).<br>
	From the dense, matted foliage to the bulbous flowers on high stalks, this alien-looking plant is one I now enjoy seeing as I whiz by.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/4X7UT1M.png" width=28%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/9QYH30g.png" width=62%><br>
	Another lupine! I previously saw rusty lupine (<i>Lupinus pusillus</i>) somewhere in Arizona, but those flowers were on much shorter stalks.<br>
	This one is Mojave lupine (<i>Lupinus sparsiflorus</i>) and, as the name suggests and can be seen in the photo, has flowers that are spaced out along the stem.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/c000cCV.png" width=90%><br>
	This is desert evening primrose (<i>Oenothera caespitosa</i>). We previsouly saw pale evening primrose (<i>Oenothera pallida</I>) in Arizona, so we're looking at their sibling here.<br>
	There is some discussion around different varieties of this plant based on leaf morphology, but I will leave it as is.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/zJ4OAp9.png" width=90%><br>
	I was chased away from the previous spot by thunder and lightning, and after realizing it wasn't the smartest idea to be the tallest thing around, I drove a few miles down the road to sunny skies.<br>
	This view looks back into Utah, at peaks that have no official names – the closest I could find was Panaca summit. On a clear day I believe I can see these hills past Empy and Mosey mountains.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/QNQfjqf.png" width=90%><br>
	I was immediately greeted once again by globemallow (<i>Spharalcea parvifolia</i>) with its wonderful orange parabolic flowers.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/5y4FJlI.png" width=90%><br>
	This is undoubtedly some type of Phlox (a little water stressed, too), but I am uncertain which one. It could be either longleaf phlox (<i>Phlox longifolia</i>) or cold desert phlox (<i>Phlox stansburyi</i>).<br>
	Both share similar habits, morphology, and habitats so I will leave it there.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/3PgiQih.png" width=90%><br>
	Crossing the street, we see Highland Peak, just west of Panaca (there will be a quiz). On this mountain there is a repeater I use to talk to Ely dispatch every day at the tower.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/NXbYpb9.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/9dzHunD.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/MUwUaap.png" width=45%><br>
	More prairie-fire! This one is northwestern prairie-fire (<i>Castilleja angustifolia</i>), and it really pops out among the desert. This group of plants has quickly become a favourite of mine out here.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/eFKNGzc.png" width=45%><br>
	Once again we see wandering mariposa lily (<i>Calochorus flexosus</i>), previously seen in Zion canyon.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/8tZQ6Pl.png" width=90%><br>
	I'm pushed towards a kind of ragwort (<i>Senecio</i> spp.) but I'm not sure which one. Hopefully I'll have more time to look at desert Asters soon.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/9XzRV4O.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/hFU71bC.png" width=45%><br>
	Mojave desertstar (<i>Monoptilon bellioide</i>) was found in and around some of the shrubbery here, just a smidge past its prime it seems.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/v9RhbrQ.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Izy8J0S.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ZWGkfPI.png" width=50%><br>
	I couldn't figure out this goober – seems to put all of its energy into disk flowers with a few ray flowers. An Aster of some kind but I'm not sure where it falls.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ujT45H6.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/OT5TThG.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/fP7zZxe.png" width=90%><br>
	Look at this little fella! I almost missed him but am glad I managed to spot him, and in full bloom too! Reading online suggests this is beehive cactus or spinystar (<i>Escobaria vivipara</i>).<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/jyYG6qK.png" width=50%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/QOxIoYR.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/TnOZ1Dn.png" width=45%><br>
	The third penstemon I've been able to stop and photogrpah, this one being Thurber's beardtongue (<i>Penstemon thurberi</i>).<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/jU0zQGf.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/IuNSvrB.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/H0ssVxX.png" width=90%><br>
	This is winged four o'clock (<i>Mirabilis alipes</i>), not yet in bloom. You can see the buds juuust developing, and when they open it'll be a bright pink display.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/JSybKA9.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/EtehROM.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/YNrSC9o.png" width=90%><br>
	Further up the road we find Mojave popcorn flower (<i>Oreocarya confertiflora</i>), with a fitting name both in form and the fact that it popped up everywhere on this turnoff.<br><br><br>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/YJ6ZTGX.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/0G7mHQO.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/jEKDilZ.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ETaBn1U.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/JU4fyGl.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/a5rryTW.png" width=50%><br>
	Lots of photos for this charismatic plant: nakedstem sunray (<i>Enceliopsis nudicaulis</i>). Check out the velvety stem, leaves, and calyx that create that bluish hue.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/uJyxfQY.png" width=90%><br>
	This goober let me get pretty close before taking off at top speed.<br><br><br>


	<img src="https://imgur.com/SgdWUPb.png" width=50%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/fFIHhoa.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/r4Y8vu1.png" width=45%><br>
	This is prairie flax (<i>Linum lewisii</i>). It can also produce bright blue blooms but every specimen I've seen in Nevada has been white like this one.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/y9VWHqb.png" width=90%><br>
	Another lupine! I'm stuck between Lake Tahoe lupine (<i>Lupinus meionanthus</i>) and silvery lupine (<i>Lupinus argenteus</i>). As things have started to dry, the leaves were difficult to parse.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/EfFX6od.png" width=90%><br>
	This was longer than it really needed to be, but I've been enamoured with the wildflowers since I've arrived and hoped to share them. I'll get to woody and non-showy plants when the wildflowers wither.<br>
	I don't mean to neglect the other species present, but there really is beauty in the ephemeral.<br><br>
	The next update should include more tower information – I've been hard at work cleaning it up for the season.<br><br>

	<h3>Day 0 - De-Wintering Ella Mountain</h3>
	<h4>2023.05.19</h4>
	We were finally able to make it up to Ella Mountain today, after concerns about inacessibility due to road washouts from high snowpack.<br>
	I've been floating around the engine crews all week and have been learning some of the ins and outs of their work, but it was nice to finally get up to where I'll be working this summer.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CpHkSjP.jpg" width=90%><br>
	I didn't have too many photos of the view as there were other tasks to be done at the station and this was more of a quick in-and-out to see how the tower was after winter.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2kXHsv4.jpg" width=90%><br>
	Forgive the quality of my phone camera.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oFV4Ci0.jpg" width=45%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ziKqu84.jpg" width=45%><br>
	The windows of the tower were covered by metal shutters that either fold up and out of the way or are fastened to the lower wall.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hg1QxfI.jpg" width=40%><br>
	It was dark and dusty inside before we opened the shutters – all of the linens were taken back to the station for a solid wash.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/66iMGys.jpg" width=90%><br>
	But when all was said and done it brightened up quite nicely. As is the point of the tower, I have a nearly unobscured view of the surrounding landscape for quite a ways, even on hazy days such as today.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gc1JVCK.jpg" width=90%><br>
	In the center of the room is the Osborne Fire Finder, a device used to give direction and distance of a spotted fire. In areas where towers are close enough, these are used to triangulate fires.<br>
	However, this is the sole tower in Nevada, and my use of the Osborne Fire Finder will give others an idea of where to look.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wLHOtyv.jpg" width=90%><br>
	These windows need a heavy application of cleaner, among the other tasks needed to get this tower up to snuff for regular operation.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HXymk69.jpg" width=45%><br><br>
	<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082109058762428426/1109245167157907496/IMG_20230519_134931451_HDR.jpg" width=90%><br>
	Day zero at the tower, looking forward to the season!<br><br>

	<h3>Zion National Park, Utah</h3>
	<h4>2023.05.14</h4>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/xaZJbwV.png" width=90%><br>
	Had enough time before my start date in Nevada to make a detour and spend the morning in Zion National Park – a longtime dream of mine. <br>I hadn't even left the park and kept thinking "I have to find a way to come back".<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/UmqzUUd.png" width=90%><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/qkLrFr3.png" width=70%><br>
	I parked outside the park and walked in through the south visitor's center early in the morning Sunday, making sure to get a cancellation on my National Parks passport.<br>I found the "Please do not apply cancellation to your government-issued passport" notice funny.<br><br>

	<h4><u>Watchman Trail</u></h4>
	I started with the Watchman trail, starting right by the visitor's center. The trail is just over 3 miles with over 360 feet of elevation gain and took around two hours to complete, and there were plenty of showy plants to see.<br>
	<br><br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/sA81Azp.png" width=62%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/y8Tn79P.png" width=28%><br>
	Early on you're greeted by banana yucca (<i>Yucca baccata</i>), which remains intermittent throughout the entire trail.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/9IhxNPy.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/IVHu96J.png" width=45%><br>
	You'll also see more blackbrush (<i>Coleogyne ramosissima</i>), this time in bloom! What a difference a move into the canyon can make for bloom time.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/mzv5zNi.png" width=90%><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/F36nyyK.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/mGJuNCv.png" width=45%><br>
	These tall mountain larkspurs (<i>Delphinium scaposum</i>) belong to the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, and were almost missed as I went up the trial.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/krNHMF8.png" width=55%><br>
	Another <i>Castilleja</i>, this one being <i>Castilleja appelgatei</i>, Applegate's paintbrush or wavyleaf paintbrush. From here, the trail goes up.<br><br><br>


	<img src="https://imgur.com/NWsmoF0.png" width=90%><br>

	Colorado four o'clock (<i>Mirabilis multiflora</i>) giving a nice violet pop as you make your way up.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/AYSQFwE.png" width=35%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/EXSaRb8.png" width=55%><br>
	A new plant to me whose name I adore, roundleaf buffaloberry (<i>Shepherdia rotundifolia</i>). It's weird to see a member of Elaeagnaceae and not have a gut reaction of disgust.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/nmPivS0.png" width=55%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/K63yXbm.png" width=35%><br>
	Here's one that completely surprised me: an ash! Singleleaf ash (<i>Fraxinus anomala</i>) is one of two ash species in Zion valley.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/gvRYcsC.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/F78Yy7P.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/hGE0Lr7.png" width=45%><br>
	Utah penstemon plant (<i>Penstemon utahensis</i>) with a brilliant red ready for any hummingbirds that may be nearby (according to the internet, and as suggested by their tubular flowers).<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/d9umAwY.png" width=90%><br>
	  I was told that this little fellow is a Woodhouse's scrub jay - this shot didn't pick up their vibrant blue colour.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/qfOntUo.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/AnqihQ7.png" width=90%><br>
	I took far too many photos at the end of the trail before turning back and hiking down.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/YrKWVKL.png" width=90%><br>
	On the way down I saw plants I didn't notice on the way up, such as this winding mariposa lily (<i>Calochortus flexuosus</i>).<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/rX7Gl36.png" width=90%><br>
	Or these scouringrush horsetails (<i>Equisetum hymenale</i>)! These were in clusters along an area where a water flow trickles over the trail. I'm always happy to see <i>Equisetum</i>.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/r91L4HL.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/abYFj0k.png" width=45%><br>
	Desert marigold (<i>Baileya multiradiata</i>) catching the sun as it came out from behind the canyon peaks. Zoom in on the stem and note how densley pubescent it is – an adaptation against water loss.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/1CocUID.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/FEHz23y.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/MYIxzFo.png" width=90%><br>
	Walking back to the visitor's center, Fremont cottonwood (<i>Populus fremontii</i>) lines the riverbank.<br><br><br>

	<h4><u>The Zion Shuttle and Going Up the Canyon</u></h4>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/fcrcySP.png" width=28%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/RF41jyP.png" width=62%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/aUjucOT.png" width=90%><br>
	Parking outside and walking into the park was great, as it meant I could hop on Zion's free shuttle to get up and down the canyon to see more.<br>
	Personal cars are prohibited inside the canyon itself, so you get a nice ride through a stunning vista, and the valley itself is quiet given the low traffic.<br><br>
	Given my time constraint to get to Nevada for work (and the fact that I didn't plan ahead at all) meant that I didn't go as far as the Narrows, nor did I apply for an Angel's Landing pass – those will be on my radar for next time.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/7lgxBAR.png" width=90%><br>
	The Court of the Patriarchs was a short but steep walk from shuttle stop 4. From left to right, the peaks are named Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/Q1BFtk9.png" width=28%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/3Whm0d1.png" width=62%><br>
	It was here that I first noticed Gambel oak (<i>Quercus gambelii</i>) as it provided nice shade as the day started to warm up.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ehasRT2.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/BMmy0Gy.png" width=90%><br>
	I'm no geologist but looking at this geologic wonder of a valley, I wish I was one.<br><br><br>

	<h4><u>Weeping Rock</u></h4>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/vtlXdXf.png" width=90%><br>
	Stop 7 brings us to Weeping Rock, a phenomenon that occurs as water percolates through permeable rock, forming a beautiful hanging garden where it drops.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/fRI3ssS.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/6qR3IT4.png" width=65%><br>
	Zion shootingstar (<i>Primula pauciflora var. zionensis</i>) is a very charismatic species that is well known from its presence here. I didn't realize until after I left the park and did some reading that it is relatively short-bloomed, so I'm glad I was able to see it during my detour here. Note the black maidenhair fern (<i>Adiantum capillus</i>) subtending the basal leaves of the Zion shootingstar.<br>There were a decent number of species here that I neglected to photograph.<br><br><br>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ifGtE3Y.png" width=90%><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/9lUki5m.png" width=90%><br>
	Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i>)! I thought I caught it on the way in but only took a photo on the way out of the Weeping Rock trail.<br>I couldn't get close, but it must be the Rocky Mountain variety based on range.<br><br><br>

	<h3>Trip to Nevada - Arizona and Utah</h3>
	<h4>2023.05.13</h4>
	Had a chance to stop and do a little bit of botanizing on my way out west. Everything up until this point was me looking at plants as I drove down the highway at 70 mph wondering what they were. <br><br>

	<h4><u>Somewhere in Arizona</h4></u>
	First stop was a scenic overlook somewhere in Arizona. Neglected to take any plant photos as I was just happy to be out of the car.
	<img src="https://imgur.com/7YbFAON.png" width=90%><br>

	Following that stop was a quick pulloff without a marker, I just really wanted to see what was growing there.<br>It's apparent I drove through at the right time because so much was in bloom.<br>

	Globemallow (<i>Spharalcea parvifolia</i> with brilliant orange that tended to group together on the side of the road.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/4UmMKNF.png" width=45%><br>
	Pale evening primose (<i>Oenothera pallida</i>) looking nice with a very funky 4-merous style.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/zEPqW5o.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/B8u8Hpb.png" width=45%><br>
	Rusty lupine (<i>Lupinus pusillus</i>) with a vibrant violet flower and fuzzy legumes.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/NHrdL2R.png" width=90%><br>
	Canaigre dock (<i>Rumex hymenosepalus</i>) in bloom. It reminds me of oakleaf hydrangea blossoms that are past their prime.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/mnlHaal.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/GQIynrr.png" width=45%><br>
	I believe this is desert blazingstar (<i>Mentzelia multiflora</i>). There are several varieties listed but I couldn't hone in on which one.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/FivTQlD.png" width=90%><br>
	My first desert grass ID. This is downy brome (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>), also known as cheatgrass – a horrible invasive that was very common along my route.<br><br><br>


	<h4><u>Glen Canyon Dam</h4></u>
	The next stop was Glen Canyon Dam followed by the Wahweap Overlook. Spent a good hour here enjoying the fresh air and spectacular views.<br>

	View of the Glen Canyon dam bridge.<br><br><br>	

	<img src="https://imgur.com/kjstEGF.png" width=90%><br>
	Of course there were all sorts of cool-looking plants just out of reach on the other side of this fence.<br><br><br>

	<h4><u>Wahweap Overlook</u></h4>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/iUuHtWl.png" width=90%><br>
	Panorama of the view from the top of the Wahweap Overlook (I recommend opening this image in a new tab and zooming in).<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/IToDY53.png" width=90%><br><br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/6QzsJvm.png" width=90%><br>
	I passed by lots of cholla cactus in New Mexico, but this plains prickly pear (<i>Opuntia polyacantha</i>) was the first cactus I was able to photograph.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/l9XLw3i.jpg" width=45%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0GmkqdN.jpg" width=45%><br>
	I believe this is blackbrush (<i>Coleogyne ramosissima</i>), a scrubby Rosaceace plant. Its blooms were not quite ready to open yet.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/4pa9v9Y.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/36joKyt.png" width=45%><br>
	A brittlebush (<i>Encelia</i> sp.) bloom, exposed on the mountaintop.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/EeGQFfG.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/VJvzyD9.png" width=45%><br>
	Some barley (<i>Hordeum</i> sp.) growing right on the edge. It's easy to focus in on the plants but it's also important to put them into their environmental context.<br><br><br>

	<h4><u>Utah Sunset</u></h4>
	<img src=https://imgur.com/ulXgsQs.png" width=90%><br>
	Another panorama, taken off the side of the highway shortly after crossing into Utah. Listening to "Clair de Lune" while driving here as the sun was setting was really cathartic.<br>Once again I recommend opening in a new tab and zooming in.<br><br><br>

	Brilliant colour on this prairie-fire (<i>Castilleja</i> sp.), even in the low light of this photo.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ME9WEE9.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/1SJ0kB2.png" width=45%><br>
	I believe this is Thompson's beardtongue (<i>Penstemon thompsoniae</i>). I had nearly missed it but when I became aware of it I realized it was all over the ground!<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ZJBEPnx.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/YXetBYO.png" width=45%><br>
	Desert bitterbrush (<i>Purshia glandulosa</i>) about to pop.<br><br><br>

	Onto woody plants.<br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/FIqDqX7.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ppfdE7j.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/yLoSWfh.png" width=45%><br>
	Piñon pine (<i>Pinus edulis</i>) in person! This charismatic little fella has been on my list for quite some time now. No cones to spot on the branches though.<br><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/CGVIF5t.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Dvx7Enm.png" width=45%><br>
	A juniper (<i>Juniperus</i> sp.) I didn't have time to key out with some funky-looking cones.<br><br><br>

	Overall, a few great stops but I wish I had taken some more time and made more stops in New Mexico and east Arizona. Hopefully I can do so on the way back. <br><br> Next stop, Zion!<br><br>

	Had to pull over less than 100 miles in - headgasket issue. Officially part of the Subaru Club!
	<br>Towed the car and will be stowing it for the summer. Flew to Texas and borrowed my sister's car to do the rest of the drive.

	Western side of Pilot mountain, a monadnock. This quartzite is over 550 million years old and is the ancient sand deposits from the time of Gondwana and Laurasia. Rock tripe (<i>Umbilicaria</i> sp.) is growing up the cliff face, seen as black texture on the rock.

	<h3>Croatan, Hofmann, and Cool Springs</h3>
	<h4>June 2019</h4>
	Some shots from my time in NCSU's Forestry Summer Camp. Most of the time was spent in the Croatan and Hofmann forests, with some time spent at Cool Springs nearby.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/NUXbhdJ.png" width=90%></br>
	Sassafras is one of my favourite species to see in longleaf pine communities, I'm always sure to pull a leaf to smell.
