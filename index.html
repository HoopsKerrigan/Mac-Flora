	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The latest post can be found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

<h2>South Pole Overland Traverse - SPOT</h2>
	<h4>2024.11.23</h4>

	<font size="2">From reddit user The_Borpus.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	Let me be <b>EXTREMELY</b> clear up front: I had very limited interaction with the SPOT crew and cannot speak for the ins and outs of the mission. This post is a brief detail on what I know before pointing you in the proper directions to learn more about this extremely cool project.<br><br>
	SPOT, the South Pole Overland Traverse, is a project that aims to reduce the footprint for delivering cargo and fuel from McMurdo station to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Tractors pull fuel in huge bladders and cargo on sleds, along with a few buildings for living, sleeping, and storage, nearly 1,000 miles across the Ross Ice Shelf and the Leverett Glacier.<br><br>

	The route is flagged and has been reused since the start of its constrution in 2002-2003, but road conditions vary from powdery snow to slush to hardened sastrugi, compacted snow drifts formed by wind. The main concern are crevasses, which form at the meeting points of the ice shelf and glacier, so tractors must take great care on the route. I've been told by a SPOT driver that the bumps felt when going over sastrugi jostle you around so much that your temper shortens and you get "tractor angry". Think hands tightly clutched and your body hunched over the steering wheel with an evil eye.<br><br>
	Altogether the bladders on one tractor can carry over 20,000 lbs of fuel and save approximately 30 to 40 flights to the South Pole each summer – historically, the LC-130H planes would fly down to the South Pole with more than enough fuel for their return trip to McMurdo station and simply offload the extra fuel. However, poor weather in the summertime can delay and drastically reduce the number of flights that make it to the Pole, raising concern for meeting necessary fuel stores before winter.<br><br>

	SPOT is seen as a more reliable and less carbon-intensive way to get fuel and some cargo down to the Pole, with the added bonus of being able to take some waste and cargo back up to McMurdo on the return journey. As you can imagine, 20,000 lbs of fuel per tractor is quite heavy, and the journey south averages 5 MPH and takes, on average, over a month to complete (the fastest I've ever heard it done was three weeks). The return journey, unburdened by all of the fuel, averages over 10 MPH and takes only a few weeks. On the internal mailing list, we would often get updates on where the SPOT team was and what they were seeing.<br><br>
	That's about all I know about SPOT – below are some links to other looks, videos, and firsthand accounts of people on the SPOT team. Props to them - they were treated like superstars on station from what I saw and they deserved it. With such a remote environment and limited team, everyone has to be multi-talented in order to fill several jobs at once; mechanic, meteorologist, cook, driver, and more.<br><br>

	I urge you to read on, as it's such an interesting topic and impressive solution to such a large challenge I couldn't leave it out. Unfortunately, I wish I knew more about the project as a whole but will leave it to those who know it better.<br><br>
