	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The latest post can be found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

<h2>Working on the Ice Shelf – Williams Airfield Galley</h2>
	<h4>October 30 – November 3, 2023</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vOhkO9q.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	For the first two weeks of my time at McMurdo, I was on the AM shift in the main galley in Building 155. Towards the end of October I was pulled aside and asked if I would like to take the reigns and be the sous chef for Williams Airfield Galley, more commonly referred to as Willy Galley.<br><br>
	<center>

	</center>
	I wrote a bit about the ice shelf when talking about Ob Hill, but here's some more detail. Williams Airfield is one of two airfields found at McMurdo Station. Its main priority is to serve as strips for any plane that comes and goes on skis, the regulars of which are DHC–6 Twin Otters, Basler BT–67s, and LC-130Hs. Phoenix Airfield is used for flights coming and going from Cheech and its main regulars are the Boeing C–17 Globemaster III, the Boeing 757, and the Airbus A340–300 – all of which are wheeled aircraft and largely operate at the start and end of the season, with a "flight gap" in the middle when temperatures appraoch 35F and the runway becomes too soft. I have lots of fun photos of planes, but that's for another post.<br><br>
	For some information from the National Science Foundation on the ice runways near McMurdo, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/support/landstrp.jsp">see this page</a>.<br><br>

	</center>
	Willy Airfield, however, is operational throughout the season and does the heavy lifting for intracontinental flights to the South Pole and to Deep Field research sites such as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) divide. As Willy airfield is more consistently busy throughout the season, an ad hoc galley is put into operation for the entire duration of mainbody, lasting from the start of November to the middle of February.<br><br>

	</center>
	I've planned a whole post to detail food on the ice, but here's a taste. The airfield galley follows the main/Building 155 galley menu cycle and operates for 24 hours a day during the mainbody season. Similar to the main galley, there were three shifts of cooks: an AM chef to handle breakfast and lunch, a PM chef to handle dinner, and a midnight ration ("Midrat") chef to do the overnight lunch and to prep breakfast. The service consisted of a cold line with anywhere from 4 to 8 items, a hot line with 4 items (a meat, a vegetarian option, a vegetable, and a starch), as well as a bread and dessert. In addition to the full service line, which was only put out at set meal periods, there was a part of the galley set aside for things like sandwiches, cereals, oatmeal, waffles, and beverages for those coming in to snack between meal periods.<br><br>
	Mealtime headcounts varied depending on time of day, time of season, menu items, and flight schedules, but as rough averages go:<br><br>

		</style>
		<table class="tg"><thead>

		    <td class="tg-baqh">Midrat</td>
		    <td class="tg-baqh">25</td>
		  </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	</center><br><br>
	As I said, those are average headcounts. There were some breakfasts where we saw twice as many come in. Some days for lunch saw us feeding well over 100, and some rare days saw us feeding fewer than 5. It was very important to be able to pivot at a moment's notice and to consider preparing backups on days with popular menu items (chicken tenders always went <i>fast</i>).<br><br>

	<font size="2">We served over 110 during this mealtime.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	Anyone who worked on the airfield was part of the expected crowd for mealtimes, and the largest clientele were the New York Air National Guard (NYANG), followed by the Firefighters, then cargo workers, fleet ops, and fuelies. NYANG usually came all at once and tended to eat quickly, leading us to call their rush the "green wave", as within twenty minutes the galley would go from empty to filled with olive green jackets to empty again.<br><br>
	As I said, flights to and from the Pole and Deep Field sites were the priority of Willy, and it was often that passengers would come into the galley to wait for their pickup and grab a snack. While they were more than welcome to help themselves to the "snackables" area, they were meant to pack flight lunches in town and as such weren't included in the planned headcount for mealtimes.<br><br> 
	If you're a future Willy galley chef reading this, those are the basics. I'm sure I'll detail on it more when discussing food specifically, but this post is meant to talk about de-winterizing the Willy Galley and getting it ready for the upcoming season. 
	First, the buildings had to be put into place. All of the runway buildings are set upon skis so they can be shifted around for winterization. Before mainbody, the survey team goes out to properly mark and configure the runway buildings. By the time I arrived at the runway, all of the buildings were in place.<br><br>

	All of the kitchen equipment is kept in the galley over the winter, packed as snugly as it can be to prevent things going everywhere when the buildings are moved. Below are photos showing what it was like when the Willy-crew-to-be arrived on scene to de-winterize:<br><br>

	</center>
	We had a few days before service was to start where we made sure everything was in order: that equipment was functioning properly, the kitchen layout was efficient, and that the dining area was properly set up. It was during this time that plumbers, electricians, HVAC, insulators, IT, etc. It was all hands on deck to get the galley up and moving, not to mention the numerous other buildings found at Willy.<br><br>

	For santiary food service, hot water is needed on-demand (out of a tap), which wasn't hooked up right out of the gate. While we were waiting the first week or so for all of the plumbing to be sorted out, we offered grabbable snacks and frozen microwave meals for those working to get the airfield ready for the arrival of NYANG.<br><br>

	But that's the quick rundown on opening up Willy Field. Another thing to note is that Willy field doesn't have the only galley on the ice shelf. I briefly mentioned the Long Duration Balloon (LDB) site, which is another field location located out on the ice shelf.<br><br>

	This site is mostly staffed by NASA scientists who are part of a series of balloon projects that carry heavy payloads (namely telescopes), the most recent of which was the Galactic/Extragalactic ULDB Spectroscopic Terahertz Observatory (GUSTO). This is the very short version of it based on what I've seen in science talks and from talking with some of the researchers there. For a light introduction to these projects, here are some links detailing <a href="https://www.csbf.nasa.gov/balloons.html">the balloons themselves</a> as well as <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/scientific-balloons/nasa-scientific-balloons-ready-for-flights-over-antarctica/">GUSTO's launch</a> and its <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/scientific-balloons/gusto-breaks-nasa-scientific-balloon-record-for-days-in-flight/"> record-setting flight</a>.<br><br>

	Most of my time at LDB (only a few visits) was spent at the galley, doing deliveries and pickups from the galley there as we went to and from Willy field for the day. The galley is situated in this long, caterpillar-like building and houses one of two gas ranges that I know of on or near McMurdo station. They also had a propane grill out back, though I never saw that used. I should note that this is due to the fact that being in such a dry environment, already on a knife's edge of habitable, fire is of great concern and a lot is done to minimize risk of ignition. Everything I cooked with on ice was electric.	They say the food at LDB was the best on station, and this I don't doubt - the cooks there kicked ass and really made the most of the remote cooking environment.<br><br>

	</center>
	While I never got a chance to see inside, it was very cool to see what are recognized to be the tallest buildings on the continent, standing at over three stories tall. These are the buildings where the payloads for LDB projects are put together, mounted, and rigged for flight.<br><br>

	You can actually see these buildings from the rear dock of Willy Galley.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	And that's the not-so-short of the ice shelf galleys, particularly Willy Galley where I spent most of my time on ice! Thanks for reading this long deluge, and know that I'll definitely write more about the food on ice since it's such an interesting topic.<br><br>
