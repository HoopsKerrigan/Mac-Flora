	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The latest post can be found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

<h2>Great Basin National Park</h2>
	<h4>2023.07.25</h4>
	</center>
	I finally had a chance to get outside and get moving on my most recent couple of days off (two weeks ago I was in St. George to visit the doctor, dentist, and optometrist over my days off so no fun photos then). I chose to visit Great Basin National Park as I had been watching their weather page for weeks waiting for Wheeler Peak and the Bristlecone Loop to open for the season.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/7xK8B2f.png" width=60%><br><br>
	</center>
	I've been wanting to see the Great Basin bristlecone pines for years now and they've been high on my list of trees I want to see in person (right up there with the redwoods and sequoias), so I jumped at the opportunity to go hike to see them.<br><br>
	The day started at the Visitor's Center located near Baker, NV, where I chatted with the ranger, perused around the interpretive display, and picked up a stack of postcards to mail. From there, I drove up to the Lehman Caves visitor's center and was lucky enough to nab a spot in the 4 PM tour to the Lodge Room, giving me a deadline by which to return. Until then, I headed up the mountain.<br><br>
	Great Basin National Park is located on the eastern border of Nevada just two hours north of Caliente and is centered around Wheeler Peak, the second-tallest peak in Nevada with a summit height of 13,065 feet/3982 meters. Its prominence is over 7500 feet, so you can really get a feel for the size of the mountain as it juts out of the surrounding valleys of lower elevation.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/NyS9kH2.png" width=18%><br><br>
	</center>
	I started with the Osceola Ditch trail, a hike that starts at ~8000 feet elevation, not quite halfway up the Wheeler Scenic Drive. You can take the trail all the way down to the historic channel built by 18th century miners, a 9 mile round trip, or you can hike only a few miles round trip to a nice creek after taking in nice views of the valley and the opposing Schell Creek Range.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/bYsmPY0.png" width=76.6%><br><br>
	Early in the hike you come across a nice meadow with a variety of wildflowers (back to plants! It has only been nearly a month...), and more tucked under the forest canopy.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ZSQePHt.png" width=62%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/C5E2SjX.png" width=27.55%><br>
	One that becomes more common as you find forested edges that back into clearings is this common yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>, Asteraceae).<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/unyBTd3.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/zzSlTXU.png" width=45%><br>
	The plains pricklypear cactus (<i>Opuntia polyacantha</i>, Cactaceae) pops up along the trail in some of the drier areas and seems to be doing well, as I saw a fair number of flower buds beginning to open.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/aLEuEN8.png" width=60%><br>
	Much less frequent but certainly alluring is the sego lily (<i>Calochortus nuttallii</i>, Liliaceae). I only saw two individuals of this plant, both under the forested canopy early on along the trail.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/h900zer.png" width=45%><br>
	One which I did not key out but saw along the trail was this beardtongue (<i>Penstemon</i> sp., Plantaginaceae).<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/qfd3DLc.png" width=90%><br>
	Going along the trail you eventually get excellent views of the aforementioned Schell Creek range, which separates this park from the city of Ely (where our district is seated).<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/khHfdRC.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	Should you decide to turn around, you may notice the widespread mortality that peppers the mountainside (reminiscent of our own hemlocks in the southern Appalachian mountains), and I neglected to ask a ranger of as to what may be causing this treekill. The park website has a page dedicated to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grba/learn/nature/bark-beetles.htm">bark beetles</a> and makes mention of the fir engraver beetle, but it's important to note that most bark beetles are attracted to and move in on trees that are already stressed. Should I get back to the park, I'll be sure to ask.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/AhDIEJt.png" width=75%><br>
	Farther along, there was a desert paintbrush with arms outstretched.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/F3WFnXT.png" width=62%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/CCiTwlF.png" width=27.55%><br>
	This yellow fellow is spearleaf stonecrop (<i>Sedum lanceolatum</i>, Crassulaceae) and would show up here and there as the trees got shorter in stature.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/76cloT2.png" width=27.55%>

	Speaking of the trees, the trail starts out in fir and ponderosa pine but gradually fades into piñon-juniper, with one notable difference. In other areas, we've seen two-needle piñon (<i>Pinus edulis</i>, Pinaceae). Here, however, it's distinctly single-needle piñon (<i>Pinus monophylla</i>, Pinaceae)! Not new to me, as it grows in the higher elevation areas on and around Ella Mountain, but it was nice to see up here on Wheeler.<br><br>

	Until you come across a brook that goes down the mountain. This was only a couple of miles from the trailhead, and I found it was a good spot to turn around as it took about an hour to hike (including pit stops at every wildflower).<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/aKkB1EA.png" width=90%><br>
	A bit of a creature feature, here's a Weidemeyer's admiral butterfly (<i>Limenitis weidemeyerii</i>, Nymphalidae) hanging out on a blade of grass - we're looking at their underbelly.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/RPNt9am.png" width=100%><br><br>
	Going up the mountain, there were a few scenic overlooks at which to stop and view Wheeler Peak. It's so crazy seeing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_line">treeline</a> so clearly, a phenomenon that doesn't exist out east.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ECPwEGg.png" width=90%><br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/k6nicgy.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	As you approach the Wheeler Peak campground and its associated trailheads, you cross 10,000 feet in elevation. I made sure to stop the car to take the chance to walk over that threshold, as it topped out my previous highest elevation at Rainbow Point in Bryce Canyon.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ozBtQiF.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	The Bristlecone Loop is a part of the Glacier Trail, which takes you from the Wheeler Peak campground all the way to the headwall of Wheeler Peak itself, an impressive wall of stone that forms a nice nook for snow to pack into to form Nevada's only glacier.<br><br>
	The first chunk of the trail looks like this, a wonderful forest full of limber pine (<i>Pinus flexilis</i>, Pinaceae, not photographed here), Engelmann spruce (<i>Picea engelmannii</i>, Pinaceae, photographed at the <a href="https://macflora.net/June23.html#Jun236">Grand Canyon</a>), and Great Basin bristlecone pine (<i>Pinus longaeva</i>, Pinaceae). We'll get to photographs of the gnarly bristlecones but here with ample water, they grow like typical trees with a straight form.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/g5g96QP.png" width=90%><br>
	I took a quick detour on the trail to visit Teresa lake and was surprised to find its water was incredibly clear (and coloured like baja blast). I spent a few moments here as it seriously left me stunned.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/wtxZAqf.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/9Fz2nTj.png" width=45%><br>
	Nestled under a log was this coyote mountain mint (<i>Monardella odoratissima</i>, Lamiaceae), and there were a few individuals here and there.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/mRCSa3U.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	Also on the lakeshore was what I believe to be rosy pussytoes (<i>Antennaria rosea</i>, Asteraceae). Keeping in mind the beautiful vista you just saw above, imagine me hunched over this tiny nondescript plant with my back turned to the lake.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/wvf3hNu.png" width=27.55%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/M6ZP0ha.png" width=62%><br>
	</center>
	Growing in numbers along the creek that fed into Teresa lake was Parry's primose (<i>Primula parryi</i>, Primulaceae). Curious of who Parry was, I read and found that this plant was named after Charles Christopher Parry by botanist Asa Gray. In addition to his work in botany, Parry was the first to use barometric measurements to estimate the heights of many of Colorado's peaks in the 19th century.<br><br>
	Turning around, it's time to head back to the glacier trail, and from there we head towards the older bristlecone pines.<br><br>

	And eventually you reach them! You start to notice the proportion of gnarled trees increasing little by little as you make your way farther up the mountain towards the glacier, and then all at once you realize you're right in the ancient bristlecone grove.<br><br>

	Vibrant purple cones (still maturing) and bottlebrush branches with needles in fascicles of five - a relative of our eastern white pine back in North Carolina. However, these fellas in particular are adapted to extreme conditions, exposure, short growing seasons, and low water availability – this is the stressor that gives them their magnificent form.<br><br>
	<center>

	The word "grotesque" has been scratched out here.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ppXqjaU.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	Like many other trees, bristlecone pines are self-pruning. For many species of tree, when a branch is using more energy or water through respiration than it is producing through photosynthesis, it will be cordoned off and allowed to wither and fall off so as not to bring the rest of the tree down.<br><br>
	Bristlecone pine takes this to the extreme, for water is extremely limited in some of the areas where it grows. For some of these ancient trees, there are only a few small sections of living tissue remaining with small portions of xylem (conductive tissue) transporting water from the roots for use in photosynthesis. This practice of extreme triage and self-sacrifice, paired with an already incredibly slow growth rate, allows the Great Basin bristlecone pines to succeed in such harsh environments.<br><br>
	What it yields are forms of absoultely beautiful and contorted wood that show a dance with the environment, millenia in the making. Some of the trees in this grove are well over 3,000 years old, and are by no means the oldest trees alive – that title currently goes to Methuselah in the White Mountains of California. Presented without comment are photos of the shape of these ancient pines.<br><br>

	If you look closely in the largest photo of the above set, you can see a thin strip of pine bark on the otherwise smooth and dead wood. This is an area where the roots are connected to the leaves by xylem (that conductive tissue), carrying water through that living tissue and continuing photosynthesis.<br><br>
	In the photo immediately above and to the left, you can see a small borehole, where an increment borer was used to age that particular stem.<br><br>

	After ogling the bristlecones, we continue up the glacier trail until we hit parts of the glacier itself!<br><br>

	It was absolutely surreal walking on snow in July in Nevada, but here we are.<br><br>
	</center>
	You may be able to see in the photo on the right the pinkish hue known as "watermelon snow" (<i>Chlamydomonas nivalis</i>, Chlamydomonadaceae for my algae people out there). Despite its pinkish hue, it's a unicellular green algae that does quite well on melting snow at Wheeler Peak and can be found in other alpine areas around the world.<br><br>
	However, trending warmer temperatures are actually allowing it to thrive in greater numbers than in the past, and there is currently discussion surrounding how this may impact the glacier not only on Wheeler Peak but elsewhere as the algae can lower the albedo of the snow and in fact cause greater absorption of solar energy (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JF003932">here</a> is a neat article modeling how snowmelt is impacted by algae and other particulates).<br><br>

	Once again I suffer from the inability to properly convey scale in my photos, but the walls of Wheeler dwarf you. The echos you can do here are phenomenal.<br><br>

	Somewhere (according to the only coordinates I could find online, so take this with a heap of salt) up this slope lies the stump of Prometheus, the tree that was dated as the oldest living organism at over 4,900 years old.<br><br>
	This story is a sad one, but the short version is that Donald Currey (a graduate student from UNC Chapel Hill) was in search of the oldest trees and was coring trees in the grove beneath Wheeler Peak. Working in 1964, Currey became aware of the tree named Prometheus, and he goes to age it. The story gets a little cloudy, but for one reason or another Currey gets permission from the Forest Service to cut the tree and determine its age, only to find that he had just cut and killed the oldest tree ever found.<br><br>
	Scroll to the bottom of <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grba/planyourvisit/identifying-bristlecone-pines.htm">this page</a> on the Great Basin park site, or you can peruse the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(tree)">wikipedia article</a>. A good ending to this story is that the cutting of Prometheus and Currey's story actually helped in the protecting of this grove and the ancient bristlecones that grow there. It's a little too fitting that the tree named Prometheus suffers after giving knowledge to us people.<br><br>
	We are a speck on this timeline but the pursuit of knowledge makes it all worthwhile, even if there are horror stories in how things were done and how certain knowledge came to be. All that matters is we learn and be better.<br><br>

	After making it as far up the glacier trail as I could go, I turned around and headed once more to the visitor's center for a quick postcard-writing session before the Lehman caves tour.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/vlB28vP.png" width=90%><br><br>
	Once again we go away from plants, this time by way of going underground where sunlight doesn't reach. I'd never been in a cave before so this blew my mind, and Bryce the tour guide was excellent.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/YRfr2Ru.png" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Bryce framed the whole tour through stories, and gave insight on the stories that make Lehman cave. He started over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian age when the area was at the bottom of the sea and dying sea creatures deposited calcium that would eventually form the limestone that the cave is made up of today. As the continent buckled and shifted over millions of years, the process that formed the Great Basin (America's stretch marks) would allow this limestone to be exposed and eventually eroded away. As these eroded chambers grew in size, water dripping through them would deposit limestone and over thousands and millions of years, formations we see today in the caves were developed.<br><br>
	<center>
	<a href="http://npshistory.com/brochures/grba/caves.pdf">Here</a> is a brief but good printout about some of the history of Lehman caves.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/shyGnDZ.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/WOceLMu.png" width=45%><br><br>
	</center>
	The features seen in Lehman cave are incredibly slow to form. That drip, drip, drip of limestone-filled water takes time, and you can see what are called "soda straws" in the above photo – incredibly thin and delicate stalactites. It takes roughly 100 years for 1 inch of a soda straw to form, so imagine how long it takes for these other formations to develop.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/UUC9TM6.png" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Bryce then went into how Lehman caves were rediscovered by Absalom Lehman, noting that there are many many stories of how he came to discover it (and giving his personal favourite of how Lehman chased a packrat that had stolen his bacon sandwich and darted into the cave). At this, Bryce turned off his lights and had us sit in the pitch darkness to let us recognize what the cave looked like before humans. I won't spoil the rest of that experience but until that moment I had never experienced true, absolute darkness, and I couldn't help but smile the entire time because it was a new and surreal experience.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/toQPgAp.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/hcSBjby.png" width=45%><br><br>
	</center>
	In some of these images you may spot areas where stalactites have been broken, leaving a blunt bottom. After rediscovery, Lehman became sole proprietor of the caves and charged people for access. With this access came a policy of "if you can break it, you can take it". Cavegoers, eager to take a souvenier home, would break off what they could. There were many places we stopped where Ranger Bryce would point out an area of broken rock and describe the formation that used to be there. While a little gloomy, the point was clear – people in the past muffed it up and now there are parts of the cave we can no longer enjoy.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://www.nps.gov/grba/learn/nature/images/cool_pseudoscorpion_resized.gif" width=25%>
	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Diplura.jpg/1200px-Diplura.jpg" width=29.5%><br><br>
	</center>
	As we made it to the last stop on the tour, the Lodge room, Bryce gave an incredible account of what lives in the cave. He had mentioned that bats use the natural cave entrance (previously sealed but reopened in the 1990s) and will roost there in the summertime, but this tale was that of predation. The Great Basin pseudoscorpion (<i>Microcreagris grandis</i>, Neobisiidae - pictured above, left, <i>NPS photo</i>) is a false scorpion that is only found within the caves of Great Basin National Park. It has two pincers but no true stinger, and spends its entire life underground. In the cave, one can also find the campodeid dipluran (<i>Undescribed</i>, Campodeidae - above, right, photo of <i>Campodea staphylinus</i> by Michel VuijlstekeBryce). The above right photograph is a close relative in the same class. The dipluran is entirely blind and navigates using large antennae on the front and back of its body.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/WjlyoUB.png" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Bryce then told a story of what it might be like, in complete darkness, to have a pseudoscorpion bump into a dipluran by chance and the struggle that would follow as the pseudoscorpion makes the dipluran its next meal. He then produced a photograph of a pseudoscorpion with a dipluran in its claws, a successful hunt, before letting us know that the photograph was taken just four days prior and was the first case of observed predation in pseudoscorpions. Despite being millions of years old and having been known to humans for over 100 years, we are still learning a lot from Lehman caves.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/FtLVDSh.png" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	In this room, Bryce also went over some of what historic visitors had done while in the cave. Past uses for Lehman cave include a speakeasy, a dance hall, and a movie set (in which the US Forest Service gave permission for the cave to be flooded - you can watch the entire movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76KW2fw-akM">here</a>). These haphazard uses for Lehman caves certainly changed them, and those marks are forever laid on its walls (or removed entirely).<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/qhYhHpy.png" width=62%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/8K6Anfy.png" width=27.55%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/FXhCwtY.png" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Bryce did offer hope. He had said that although numerous souveniers had been taken out of the cave, sometimes over a century ago, pieces sometimes end up making their way back. He described how some broken pieces have actually been able to be matched to where they were removed from, and a special water-soluble glue makes it possible for the rock to be fitted back, glued, and then have the glue slowly be replaced by limestone-charged water over a period of six months or more. This leaves a seamless repair, and while it will never be done for the entire spread of missing rock, it's something.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/cy8jOD9.png" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	His last story was a hypothetical of the future, and he shone a light on the feature in the above photo the entire time. He lamented on the actions of past visitors, of how they carried the cave away in their pockets or had partied in its delicate chambers. He said that the reason there are such strict rules surrounding the cave (no taking parts of the cave, no touching cave walls so as not to leave oils, be mindful of sound so as not to disturb bats, etc.) is that they can help ensure protection for future visitors. This aligns with the National Park Service goal of recreation and conservation (and is the reason for several of my rants), and it's only fair for others to be able to enjoy what we did.<br><br>
	He ends by describing the millions of years it took for the pictured stalactite to form and how large it was, only to be torn out by some eager visitor as a souvenier. He then focused on the soda straw, noting how it was still so small but noticeable. He said that through proper enjoyment and careful conservation, some park ranger hundreds or perhaps thousands of years into the future might shine a light on a larger stalactite, and how visitors like you and I allowed it to form unhindered.<br><br>

	After that, it was out of the cave and into the sunlight.<br><br>

	As the sun started to set, it was time for another cancellation and another stack of postcards, ready to be mailed.<br><br>
	Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it. I certainly should learn brevity but I am too excited to share these photos and have a hard time paring it down.<br>
