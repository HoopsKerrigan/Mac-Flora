	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The latest post can be found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

<h2>Preface to Antarctica</h2>
	<h4>Written July 2024</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yptu2Ex.jpeg" width=90%><br><br></center>
	I've spent a long time thinking about how I'd like to write about the ice. I knew outright that I didn't want to write about the people there, the community, the social life – things that were my favourite part of Antarctica. There are a lot of cool people there, but it's not my story to share and it would feel "wrong" to do an exposé on life down on the ice. These people are my friends, and I'm not here to gab about them.<br><br>
	I also hope not to write too much about myself – I've noticed that I've slipped myself onto this site more often as of late, and while some topics (like traveling through New Zealand) are fun, it's not the purpose of this blog. Of course, I'm pretty far removed from plants while at the buck-end of the planet. While this isn't a personal blog, it's a blog written through my lens and my experience, so understand that when reading about the ice. I had a <i>very</i> different experience from someone working in the deep field, in management, in the science labs, etc.<br><br>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u01Ifhn.jpeg" width=90%><br><br></center>
	Instead, I knew I wanted to write about some of the interesting, less personal things down there – the food, the weather, some logistics, odd quirks, neat happenings – it's kind of all over the place. It's also not as easy to tell this story chronologically. Some things were specific events, such as the first time seeing aurora. Some were "chapters", lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, such as seeing the icebreaker ship approaching and eventually dock. Some things are best written about as they evolved over the entirety of the season, such as how the view from the top of Observation hill changed over a six-month period. And lastly, some things felt more static such as the library.<br><br>
	As such, I intend to catch up on my six months of ice time by writing roughly chronologically – with certain "marker posts" that occur in order as they happened, spaced throughout with things that are a little harder to put on a timeline.<br><br>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fu8UEUt.jpeg" width=90%><br><br></center>
	A couple of things to note: I do not write with the intention of representing the National Science Foundation (NSF), the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), or McMurdo station management as a whole. These writings are of my own experiences and observations as I worked at McMurdo station from October 2023 to April 2024. If anything seems incorrect or unclear, feel free to reach out to me.<br><br>
	Also, <a href="https://brr.fyi">brr.fyi</a> is another excellent Antarctic blog, with more things detailing life at the South Pole over winter, though there are some posts about McMurdo. I highly recommend this blog, and while I hope to not have too much overlap with their posts, it's likely to happen here and there. In any case, I hope to add something new to the conversation when a similar topic is discussed, and I am in no way trying to copy subject matter from that wonderful blog.<br><br>
	With all of that out of the way, I have a fair few number of things to write about – some short, some long – so stay tuned, and thanks for reading!<br><br>
