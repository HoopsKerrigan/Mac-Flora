	<h3>The Osborne Fire Finder</h3>
	<h4>2023.06.11</h4>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/hDq0XVm.png" width=50%><br><br>
	</center>
	This morning I spotted my first two smoke columns within half an hour of each other which led to a busy morning in the district when compared to what we've been seeing. Unfortunately the two fires were small enough that our engine crew back at the station still had to go to their review (something they have been prepping for and wanting to be over for a few weeks now). I figured now is as good a time as ever to give a rundown on the Osborne Fire Finder.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/AWOmEwr.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	The Osborne Fire Finder is the centerpiece of most any staffed fire lookout tower and serves as a way to locate a fire with a high degree of accuracy. Invented by William Osborne and first put into service in 1915, the fire finder essentially acts as a compass to give direction and estimated distance relative to the fire tower.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/VdC2IBu.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	In the above photo you can see that the fire finder is made up of a circular disk with a topographical map of the area centered around the lookout tower. The radius of the disk is roughly equivalent to the operational range of the tower so if you can see it, it <i>should</i> be able to be located on the map. If not, there are a number of topographical maps of the surrounding area I can use for further aid.<br><br>

	</center>
	These topo maps have a scale of 1:100,000 and are an excellent resource for really looking at the landscape. The above photo of the spread is from when I was making that cheat sheet for peak names around the tower.<br><br>
	So how does one call in a fire with the Osborne Fire Finder?<br><br>
	<center>

	</center>
	You should have noticed these two vertical sighting apertures on either side of the disk. One is a brass plate with angles of elevation change and a slit in the center, and the other is largely empty with a set of crosshairs strung inside. They are aligned in such a way that when looking through the slit on the brass plate, you can see and line up your sight with the crosshairs, with a sliding tab that can account for change in elevation from the observer's point of view in the tower.<br><br>
	These apertures are mounted on a ring that sits outside the topographic map disk that spins freely, meaning if you spot a fire you can spin the Fire Finder until you can view it directly through the sighting apertures. The spinning ring rests on a graduated ring and is marked with degrees, with 0° being a sightline directly North of the tower.<br><br>

	When you have your sights lined up to your fire, the reading you get is your azimuth, and this is a very accurate measure of direction of the fire from the tower. If you happen to shoot an azimuth that lines up with a window frame, the door, etc., you can move the entire apparatus to try and get a better view. The stand on which it rests has two sets of rails that can be used to slide the Fire Finder back and forth if you need to make an adjustment, and it has negligible effect on the final reading.<br><br>
	You may recall that this is the sole staffed lookout tower in the state of Nevada, and that may make you wonder how distance and location can be accurately determined without a second azimuth to intersect the first and pinpoint the location of the reading. It's true that in the past, or in areas where multiple towers have overlapping operational ranges, intersection is used – triangulation isn't necessary because unlike cellular towers that use time as a way to gauge distance, when you shoot an azimuth you already have a direction and only need one intersecting reading.<br><br>
	As such, distance is a bit more relative when using one tower and that's where knowledge of the surrounding landscape and the ability to parse topographical maps comes in handy. We can use the smoke columns I spotted this morning as an example.<br><br>

	Can you spot the two fires in these photos? I promise they're there, each photo has one smoke column.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/mVdZvLe.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/5r7EiFC.png" width=46%><br>
	I'm sure now you can see where the fun of this job comes from...<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/xnXuotP.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	So the first thing to do is line the smoke up in our sights and get our azimuth. When we have that, we can start to estimate distance. First, you look at surrounding geographic features that are known to see what neighbourhood the smoke is in. In this case (the above images on the left) it was southeast of Grey Dome (a.k.a. Sugarloaf, seen in the top left of the photo), which we know is 17 miles away from the tower. From there, we have an idea of the neighbourhood in which to look on the topo map (again, this is where ability to read them comes in handy).<br><br>
	After looking on the topo map on the Fire Finder, we deduce it's south of U.S. 93 using local landmarks and the general shape of the land. Below you can see Grey Dome in the top left of the image, the lookout in the bottom right (blue circle), and U.S. 93 highlighted in yellow. We know it's somewhere south of the highway on an azimuth that shoots from the tower to just east of Grey Dome (white line).<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/jEDSfsc.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	While this is already a pretty good estimate, we can get more specific using township, range, and section. <a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/course/ffm/location/611-base-township-range-sections-corners">Here</a> is the National Wildfire Coordinating Group's page on townships, ranges, and sections, but the short version is that it's a grid system on which to pinpoint a fire.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/boI5TdX.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	You can see in the above image that along the grids on the map are labels such as "T9S", "T10S", "R70E", "R69E". These are your <b><u>T</b></u>ownships (changing with latitude) and your <b><u>R</b></u>anges. Each overlapping square of any given township and range is 36 square miles.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/UNYAZAy.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	To get more specific within that 36 square mile area, you use this little plastic square to determine what section the fire is in. The section snakes from the top right to the bottom right, and each square on this plastic card is one square mile. From there, you can give further division by "corners" – you have your four corners (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast), and your corners of the corners (northeast corner of the southwest corner) for a final division of 1/16th of a square mile.<br><br>
	This level of division can be helpful but isn't always needed, as anyone coming up on the fire should be able to see it if you can get them down to the nearest square mile. Our district tends to send both an engine and a helicopter when they can and if I can see it, the helicopter can see it. Dispatch has the exact same map and grid as the tower and they will take the township, range, and section you provide to convert it into coordinates that resources can simply plug into a GPS for quick navigation.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/kTOyKcH.png" width=60%><br>
	</center>
	So using the info we just gathered on that first smoke report, we can fill out this smoke report sheet. While all of the information is necessary, the near-exact location can be obtained with just the township, range, and section. In the case of the fire we just shot, it's R66E, T4S, Section 19.
	When you have all of that information, you fill out this sheet and call it into dispatch, basically reading down the sheet as you go along. From there, the radio becomes a beehive as dispatch calls different resources to go and get on whatever it is that you've called in.<br><br>
	With all of that information, happy hunting!<br><br>
