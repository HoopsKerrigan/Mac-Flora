	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The latest post can be found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

<h2>Observation Hill</h2>
	<h4>October through April</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OIzBgki.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	I'm starting the Antarctic barrage with Observation Hill – a short hike within town that has solid elevation gain and is a great way to stretch your legs. I choose to start with Ob Hill for a few reasons: one, it was something I did my second day on the ice with a few other new folks; two, it is looking to be one of the longer posts from my time on the ice; and three, it was an excellent way to observe changes on station over the course of the season.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IBqx58J.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Before we go up, I'd like to talk about Ob Hill from town. You can see it from most anywhere in town, all the way from Hut Point (saved for a later post), and while not necessarily imposing it is definitely ever-present. It's a nice marker as you walk around town and a reminder of "home base" when you're out on the ice shelf. Throughout the season, you can see it go from being covered in ice to bare rock and back to snowy.<br><br>
	<center>

	</center>
	Standing at 754 feet tall, it's a sharp increase in elevation and is not a hike to sneeze at as it's less than half a mile long. When it was icy, we had to put traction soles on our boots so as not to slip on our way up or down. In the summertime, it was bare rock and you could do it comfortably in running shoes. The difference in weather was always something to prepare for - when I first ascended it was -40F with wind chill, and gusts up to 30 miles and hour blowing snow and reducing visibility drastically. On the warmest days of 30F to 35F, you could do it in pants and a light sweater.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KNTFpTf.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Onto the hike itself. I'll be doing side-by-side photos of the first time I ascended as well as what it looked like on a clear day. You start in town, and you needn't worry about filling out an eFoot plan in the summer (saved for a later post), so you could do Ob Hill at any time you wanted. Starting at the Berg Field Center (the blue building in the below photo), you hang a right to start your ascent.<br><br>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WE8nXHf.jpg" width=90%></center><br>
	Going past the fuel storage tanks, you first go past this fuel pipeline (either over or under) and then it's a steep climb with some switchbacks until you reach an access road.<br><br>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QVkELSS.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EkxYBxf.jpeg" width=45%><br>
	Here you can see the difference between spring and summer.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pl1XEvC.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	At the start of the season, this was at shin-height and you could easily step over. By the end, you ducked underneath.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6GjN8lG.jpeg" width=90%><br>A looming start.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JiDRA2S.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XIR6a57.jpg" width=45%><br><br></center>
	As you approach this road, you start to see some field equipment on the ridge. This equipment includes (but is likely not limited to) a weather station and a <a href="https://www.usap.gov/videoclipsandmaps/mcmwebcam.cfm">live webcam of town, which you can view here</a>. This access road will take you back to the main road, or continue onto a flattened area that was once the site of a nuclear reactor.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GhoUTQA.jpg" width=90%><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EuGgbFT.jpg" width=70%><br><br></center>
	The reactor has long since been decomissioned and removed, and in its place you can find a plaque detailing its history on the continent. It reads:<br><br>
	<center><font size="2">
	PM-3A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT<br>
	AUTHORIZED AND FUNDED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS AUGUST 1960<br><br>

	The nuclear reactor at McMurdo has an interesting history, of which a very thorough writeup <a href=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph241/reid2/">can be found here on Stanford university's website</a>. While on paper nuclear power on the ice is a great solution to a big problem (transporting fuel, heating, desalinization), this test didn't work. To this day, "science runs on diesel".<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LO3lY3L.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D72NENc.jpg" width=90%><br>
	These platforms are all that remain of the nuclear site.</center><br>
	The remnants of the reactor is roughly one-third of the way up Ob Hill, so let's keep hiking! More switchbacks takes you up, and you begin to see more of town all at once. Eventually, you make your way to a small spot with a little shelf (I evidently don't have a photograph). I'm not sure when this was put here, but it's a good place to stop and is roughly two-thirds of the way up the mountain. When I hiked Ob Hill, I always grabbed a rock from the base of the mountain to take to the top. On my way back down, I'd drop it in this little receptacle.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OnfR4hG.jpg" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	Continuing up, your steps remain large as it feels the mountain only gets steeper. More careful footfalls are required here, especially when the trail is covered in a sheet of snow and ice. As you start to crest the mountain, you begin to see Scott Base and before you know it, you've reached the top!<br><br>
	<center>

	</center>
	At the top sits a memorial cross as well as another plaque in four languages - English, French, Spanish, and Russian. In the wintertime, the cross is boxed up to prevent damage from the harsh environment. The plaque, in English, reads:<br><br>
	<center><font size="2">CROSS, OBSERVATION HILL<br>
	THIS CROSS IN AN HISTORIC MONUMENT<br>AND PRESERVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE<br>PROVISIONS OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY.<br>IT WAS ERECTED IN JANUARY 1913 TO<br>COMMEMORATE CAPTAIN SCOTT AND HIS<br>PARTY WHO LOST THEIR LIVES ON THE<br>RETURN JOURNEY FROM THE SOUTH POLE<br>IN MARCH 1912.<br><br></font></center>
	From up here, you get a great view of McMurdo station proper, the continental mountain ranges, Phoenix airfield, Williams airfield, LDB site, Scott Base, Mount Terror, and Mount Erebus. It's truly a great place to observe (ha!) everything in the vicinity.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fxduvWw.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	This photograph looks east-northeast on the ice shelf. See those smudges? That's Long Duration Balloon (LDB), which launches long-term weather balloons holding telescopes, and Williams Airfield, which services ski-aircraft.<br>Each of these sites are about 7 miles off of Ross Island.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XdTUgMt.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	I only had a clearer photo of LDB, but you can see those two taller buildings - that's where the telescopes were assembled.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CKqXraX.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	Looking west, we see White Island. My favourite of the other islands, it always reminded me of Hoth.<br><br>
	</center>
	The prevailing winds typically came from east-northeast, and at the summit there was a south-west facing nook that blocked nearly all of the incoming wind where you could sit comfortably. Some of my favourite memories on the ice are at the summit of Ob hill, and they include but are not limited to falling asleep for a good 20 minutes, eating an orange in solitude or in good company, seeing the icebreaker come in, drawing the mountain ranges, or watching the sunset.<br><br>

	On our first ascent, with numerous people all bundled up for their first Antarctic excursion, it took us maybe an hour or more to reach the top. Each party member wore so many layers, goggles, gloves, carried hand warmers, water, snacks, the whole enchilada. My waterbottle and pizza snack both froze by the time we summited. By midsummer, when trail conditions were much less icy and things warmed up a bit, I was able to reach the top in about 18 minutes. As I said before, Observation hill is a good all-encompassing story for my season on the ice, as I did it 43 times between mid-October and mid-April.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bFJPo71.jpg" width=65.6%><br>
	It was still delicious.<br><br>
	</center>
	Going up and down so many times really gave me an appreciation for how much things changed over the course of 6 months. The first few times I descended, there were sections where you could sit down and slide for a ways. In the summer, it was all rocky. I saw Ob Hill transform from an icy monolith to a rocky hike, back to a snowy and slightly-icy peak in my time on ice. Below are a number of side-by-side comparisons of Ob Hill, taken at various points throughout the season.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7CW5LR3.jpeg" width=45%><br><br>
	</center>
	Things also changed drastically when looking around from the top. These changes were especially noticeable as the peak of summer came and the sea ice was broken up the icebreaker. Over time, you could see the initial push, the widening of the ice canal, and the eventual breakup of the thin sea ice as the wind carried it out of the Ross bay. From here you could see how light hitting town changed as the sun first spiraled up into the sky, and then spiraled back down. By the time I left the ice, the sun was behind the mountains around station for all but 45 minutes a day, where you could see it set over the ocean.<br><br>
	Below is a short video of 20 images, aligned to the best of my ability, of McMurdo station changing over the course of six months.<br><br>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/44D1KIF.gif" width=90%><br><br></center>
	If you were lucky in your timing, you could see planes take off and land at either of the two aforementioned airfields. Before the flight gap at Phoenix airfield, C17 Globemasters would rip through the sky on their way to and from New Zealand. Throughout the year, you could see the New York Air National Guard's LC-130H or Kenn Borek Air's Twin Otters and Baslers come and go from Williams airfield.<br><br>

	</center>
	I hope you can understand why Ob Hill seemed to be a good lens with which to view change around the station - it was a way to literally step out of town to get a view of everything for a moment.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dI9idQl.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	One last little fun bit about Observation Hill - there was a challenge to climb it 39 times over the course of the season. With an elevation gain of 754 feet, going up 39 times was enough to sum an equivalent elevation gain of 29,406 feet which is greater than that of the height of Mount Everest (29,031 feet). In town, there was a leaderboard to track your ascents, and I completed the challenge on February 14th. The first one to complete the challenge in the 23-24 summer was my good friend Max, who had been doing Ob Hill daily for some time since his arrival in August for Winfly.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nkKRnR4.jpg" width=60%><br>
	The rewards for completing the challenge were bragging rights and a sticker.<br><br>
	</center>
	And so starts the Antarctic barrage of posts that I've been very late on catching up on for the past several months. There is quite a lot more to write about, but I'm glad I was able to share Observation hill, a special part of my time on the ice, with you all. Thanks for reading, and I'll catch you on the flip flop!<br><br>
