	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The latest post can be found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

<h2>Lookout Cookout</h2>
	<h4>2023.07.24</h4>
	</center>
	How long and how far removed from plants can we get on a flora page? This is just a chance for the foodie in me to come out and share what I've been up to for meals while at ~7480 feet.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/04sANDe.png" width=50%><br>
	<font size=2>From the cover of the <i>Lookout Cookbook</i> (1966)</font><br><br>
	</center>
	A question I get from visitors is what do I cook and eat? The short answer: whatever I want to and am capable of. While I'm a little more remote than your average person, I'm not as remote and cut off as some other lookouts I've talked with. I'm about an hour from Caliente and am expected to check into the station at least once a week. As such, I usually have a chance to get to the grocery store when I'm down. Some other lookouts I know get food from a drop or respply once every month or more.<br><br>
	As such, I've tried to keep it varied and once I really got into the groove of staying up in the tower back in June, I made it an effort to stock a pantry up at the tower. It's a fun challenge because I have to make sure I have everything I think I'll need because there's no option of a quick run to the store should I forget anything.<br><br>
	I'm posting this information not only to share some food I've enjoyed but also to give a small bit of word on a cookbook I found back in January called the <i>Lookout Cookbook</i>. I was given a story (though anecdotal) about why this cookbook exists, and first we need some context about the time in which it was written. For the original 1938 version, see <a href="1938Cookbook.pdf">here</a>. For the 1966 edition look <a href="1966Cookbook.pdf">here</a>.<br><br>
	The story really starts back in 1933 with Franklin D. Roosevelt passing the New Deal. This was part of the government's plan to help curb the effects of the Great Depression and help bring some mobility to American citizens. Part of the New Deal was, famously, the formation of the Civilian Conservation Corps, a program that lasted from the passing of the New Deal in 1933 to 1942 when bodies were siphoned towards World War II.<br><br>

	</center>
	The Civilian Conservation Corps was an organization that meant to tackle a large number of public works projects across the United States by enlisting unemployed young men. The general criteria for enrollment was an unmarried man between the ages of 18 and 25 (later expanded to include peoples 17 to 28), and when enrolled they would work for a period of 6 months at a time with the option to work up to 4 periods for a total of two working years. Room and board were covered, and these workers were compensated $30 a month but had a compulsory allotment of $25 sent back to their families in an attempt to increase spending back home.<br><br>
	<center>

	</center>
	While many of these workers were employed in large groups while working on bridges, dams, irrigation, forest planting and health, and more, some of these workers were a little more removed from others. Remote workers such as hand crews, smokejumpers, and (more relevant to myself) fire lookouts. Workers in these positions were on their own when it came to food, as opposed to those in a large camp with the potential for a dedicated cook or team of cooks.<br><br>
	The story I was told when I was tipped off about this cookbook was that these young, unmarried men were away from home for the first time in their lives and didn't know how to cook for themselves and as a result would get themselves sick because they didn't have a full understanding on things such as safe food handling and storage. These concepts are incredibly important when working remotely, as some lookouts I've talked with today receive a single food resupply every month or even once for the entire summer. Therefore, in an attempt to curb self-inflicted food poisoning, a cookbook was developed to give recipes for people who didn't know how to safely cook for themselves. Again, take this story with a grain of salt but the fact that the cookbook exists at all likely carries a kernel of truth.<br><br>
	So what do I cook up here? Here is an assembly of some of the things I've made while alone where the air is rare. While I consider myself a decent cook, I tried out some of the recipes in the <i>Lookout Cookbook</i>.<br><br>

	Their corn fritters (with meal instead of canned corn) and cornbread were actually solid and worth repeat makes.<br><br>

	Sticking within breakfast-ish items but moving towards cinnamon you have cinnamon toast and cinnamon buns. The filling on these cinnamon buns held up better than the way I normally do it, which includes melting the fat when mixing. Doing it as described in the book prevented major leaks out of the bottom.<br><br>

	It might not be the prettiest but here is the book's biscuit recipe with its berry sauce made from mulberries I harvested from a big mulberry tree back at the station. It certainly tasted better with the pictured sunset. To the right you see its peanut butter cookies, which are pretty bog standard but still very good. I'm in the camp that your peanut butter cookies should be less sweet so you get some more of that saltiness, and it certainly shines here.<br><br>
	I try to keep cookies baked and ready for any visitors who show up to the tower. I made two dirtbikers' days when I had just pulled chocolate chip cookies from the oven when they pulled up.<br><br>

	Moving onto lunch, the cookbook was pretty close to my own vegetable soup recipe (of which I made 4 gallons worth, that'll last a hot minute). I also approximated/adjusted the book's macaroni and cheese recipe and it was pretty tasty.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/R2Nh4tN.png" width=50%><br>
	</center>
	While not following the recipe from the book, I was craving onion rings (referred to as French fried onions) and made some. Their glow in the sunset only makes them tastier, I promise.<br><br>

	Moving outside the realm of what I've tried or adapted from the <i>Lookout Cookbook</i>, here are some of the other things I've made. As I've said I consider myself an adept cook and don't really follow a recipe unless baking, so if you'd like a recipe for anything you see here feel free to reach out and I'll do my best (if only there was a <a href="https://foodmeistermac.net">website full of recipes</a> of things I cook that wasn't currently barren...).<br><br>

	On my second night up, I made it a point to have a load of freshies and do a grill out, but that hasn't been the norm since. Produce in Caliente are a little more expensive on account of it being so far out of the way from main routes, so some foods have a higher cost.<br><br>

	For the longest time I just haven't been much of a breakfast person, but back in June the nights and mornings at the tower were still cold and it was nice to get a warm pick-me-up at sunup. Tea has become more regular and I've gone back and forth between pancakes and oatmeal for breakfast. That second stack of pancakes has more of those mullberries I picked. As it has warmed up in the mornings, I've stopped eating breakfast as much as it tends to keep me full for longer in the heat.<br><br>

	My dinners are largely some kind of green and some kind of bean or carb, and my lunch is either the vegetable soup shown above or some kind of sandwich (grilled cheese, PB&J, or grilled PB&J).<br><br>

	When I was still commuting to and from the tower every day (when I was sans water in the cistern), I brought a sack lunch. This was in the form of homemade veggie wraps (including hummus, onion, lettuce, black beans, and carrots in a homemade tortilla – tortillas are expensive here) and something crunchy to munch on after. It took years of bagging snacks for lunches as a kid to get as good as what you see on the right side.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/vW2bIsc.png" width=75%><br>
	</center>
	The other day I got fancy with lunch and made a fried sandwich (hail <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seitan">seitan</a>) with battered fries. I'd never made battered fries before and only did so as I had leftover batter from the seitan and I gotta say, I'm not sure I'll go back to unbattered fries. If you have the means, I recommend at least trying it out. As an aside, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY2YN6krVtk">this</a> seitan recipe is incredibly easy and scales well.<br><br>
	Let me take a moment in here to talk about what someone might eat while working a 16 hour day on the fireline. I have it cushy up in the tower and have the availability to cook for myself, but in the middle of the woods it's a different story.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/w9uMJjc.png" width=45%>

	It's common for those on the fireline to carry either an MRE (Meal, Ready-to-Eat) or a Coyote Camp, or both. Many will buy and carry their own food items from brands like Mountain House (not pictured) or some other assemblage of items to make up their own snack bag. Let's talk about the MRE and the Coyote Camp, the latter of which is new to me since I've come out west. Both are intended to be self-contained meal packages intended for a single person who intends to burn a lot of calories in a day. The MRE has a history of use in the military (and by doomsday preppers) as those in the armed forces use a lot of energy and they need to recoup those lost calories in energy-dense food. The same is true for <s>wildland firefighters</s> forestry technicians, and most anyone you talk to within the USFS, BLM, CalFire, etc. will have chowed down on one.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://www.mreinfo.com/images/frh-5.jpg."><br>
	<font size=2>From MREinfo.com</font><br><br> 
	</center>
	One thing to note about both the MRE and the Coyote Camp is that they have some method to heat food without flame. The MRE has what is called a Flameless Ration Heater, which works by adding a small amount of water to a mix of powdered magnesium, iron, and table salt. It's my assumption that the Coyote Camp heater has a similar mix. From the first MRE I ever ate out of, the illustration with "Rock or Something" has always cracked me up as you have this pretty nifty method of heating and a comically non-technical term on the instruction diagram. Instructions for use are on the bag, but they can be found <a href="https://www.mreinfo.com/mres/flameless-ration-heater/">here</a>.<br><br> 
	As you can see in the topmost photos, these meals are made up of multiple parts and this works for both the production end and the consumer end. From a production standpoint, you can mix and match the items in an MRE so as to make the menu seem more varied. Each MRE menu is identified by its main (in the above case, Vegetable Crumbles with Pasta in Taco Style Sauce), with the other items remaining unknown. Assuming each MRE has to have one of each component to be complete (for example, a main, a side, a carb, a snack, a dessert, and a beverage), it is easier to randomly put together any number of unique "Vegetable Crumbles with Pasta in Taco Style Sauce" meals.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/eOhZVFe.png" width=40%><br><br>
	</center>
	On the consumer side, it works in two ways. For one, it means you don't have to eat your entire meal at once. This works if you want to have a steadier intake of food throughout the day (as is recommended during arduous work) or if you need to stop eating quickly for whatever reason. It also means that individuals can trade items between each other, something that happens pretty much any time you sit down to chow. Everyone seems to have their favourite food items within an MRE (my favourite dessert is a tossup between the blueberry cobbler and the pound cake), and trading seems to bring a more communal feel to mealtime, even in crummy conditions (if you look into the history and development of MREs, this is supposedly by design and intended to boost morale, particularly in soldiers).<br><br>

	</center>
	I've had a number of MREs as they work well for field work in forestry, especially if you want a warm meal on a cold day. My former supplier was my buddy Nick, and they are the one who actually offered me my first MRE. I have fond memories of my first ever "cup" of coffee, a cappuccino from a plastic bag that was likely expired long before we opened it. For more information on MREs, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal,_Ready-to-Eat#">wikipedia page</a> is comprehensive and includes menu items. For a broader look at US Military rations and how the MRE came to be, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_military_nutrition_in_the_United_States">wikipedia page</a> found here is also a good read. For a more informal look at a guy eating MREs and (sometimes decades-old) rations, look no further than the unofficial expert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2I6Et1JkidnnbWgJFiMeHA">Steve1989MREInfo</a>.<br><br>
	It may not be a rabbit hole you ever expected to go down, but food is an integral part of everyone's life and for some reason MREs are such a cool answer to a specific set of criteria that I find them interesting both in current form and in their history. A side note that I'll keep short to prevent another tangent: there are complaints about the current food situation for <s>firefighters</s> forestry technicians, namely in the sense that contractors and food suppliers try to bid low and end up meeting daily calorie requirements by providing empty calories to workers. If you want some firsthand accounts on what could be called the "Uncrustables Problem", this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wildfire/comments/155os5m/uncrustables/">reddit thread</a> has some pretty blunt opinions. Back to the Ella Mountain kitchen.<br><br>

	Meanwhile, back at the ranch, I've done some baking too. I showed the peanut butter drop cookies from the cookbook, but I also prepped a half gallon of chocolate chip cookies of my own recipe last month. This was nice to bake one or two at a time or sometimes just attack with a spoon. On the right side is some focaccia with a crack accross it from me checking the bottom's bake - a sign that it was overbaked (I was greedy for a good, deep golden colour).<br><br>

	I'll close off this longer-than-intended post with pizza. You could say that I started at the bottom on my first night at the tower with a frozen pizza cooked on the grill that was subsequently folden into a taco.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/w1PqlMr.png" width=31%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/VO3QjWR.png" width=55%><br>
	</center>
	From there, I tiptoed into a Sicilian style, which is characterized by a thick but light crust and is, most importantly, cooked in a pan. Without my pizza steel and my pizza peel, I was worried about attempting a thin-crust style pie without the ability to maximise heat transfer between a thermally dense material and the crust.<br><br>
	I will say, the two Sicilian pies I made were fantastic and reminiscent of those back at Brooklyn Pizza, and they stored well to act as lunch for the following days. After a few more weeks on a fruitless search for good pizza out here, I decided to try and make my own in the tower.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/NewrULb.png" width=60%><br>
	</center>
	And I'd say it has been a success. While there are some notable differences from what I could do with a steel, it is very tasty and not too far off. I would say that the pies I've made at the tower are, in my opinion - which I respect - the best thin-crust pizzas within at least 100 miles.<br><br>
	The oven in the tower is a little small and restricts me to a 14 to 16 inch pizza, which means I have to get creative if I want a big slice such as the one pictured above. The good thing about cooking a pizza for one is that you make the rules when cutting.<br><br>

	Take care, apologies for this long post with not one but two tangents, and thank you for reading!<br><br>
