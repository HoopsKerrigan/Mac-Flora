	Hello and Welcome! This site is a way to document the plants I've seen and the travels that have tended to accompany them as of late. The three latest posts are found here on the main page, and links to the left side will get you to everything else.<br><br>
	Most all images on the site can be opened in a new tab and zoomed in on, so if you're looking to get some extra detail you most likely can.<br><br><hr>

	<h3>Days 24 to 28 – Overnight Stay</h3>
	<h4>2023.06.16 – 2023.06.20</h4>

	I came back from my days off to be pleasantly surprised that I would be getting two shipments of water - 400 gallons each - over the next couple of days. With that came the option to start staying in the lookout tower overnight.<br><br>
	I did some grocery shopping and some prep to make sure I would have what I needeed for extended stay. This post is pretty much just me harping on how cool it is to be up here at night (and how nice it is to not have to drive an hour each way every day now).<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/1yBfQKQ.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>It starts on the 16th with a delivery of 400 gallons of water. All of it was fed through a garden hose so the process took around 2 hours and was repeated again on the 17th, leaving me with 800 gallons of water that should last me through the summer.<br><br>

	With water, I was finally able to scrub the shower (no hot water yet), clean up the rest of the kitchen, and do all of the dishes in the cabinets, a process which took much longer than expected.<br><br>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Z2voike.png" width=90%><br>
	I had bought a big load of freshies to grill up to celebrate my first night up in the tower but by the time I was done, it was getting dark and I had just enough time to grill a frozen pizza.<br><br>
	Truly living life in the lap of luxury.<br><br>

	The progression of time from evening to twilight to dusk is surreal on the mountain. It's difficult to explain but I'll try to articulate it here.<br><br>
	It's a very weird feeling having the night creep in - not uneasy, but surreal. Having such a far visibility makes it very different from just having the sky go dark. Instead, it's like a fog that creeps in and coaxes its way past and over the peaks in the east before it completely envelopes you.<br><br>
	The wind has consistently picked up as the sun starts to go down, and it blows in from almost directly east (whereas during the day it blows southerly). This always gives the odd impression that the sun isn't going down as a result of the rotation of the earth but rather that the winds themselves are pushing the sun over the horizon and that they carry the darkening sky with them, like a sheet being pulled over your head.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/nAgSGyX.png" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Never before have I been so aware of the tradeoff between day and night and it's hard not to feel very conscious of the threshold between the two. The winds that carry the night get stronger and will buffet the tower and whistle through every tiny crack for the entire night (a feeling and sound I actually find comforting). The twilight lingers for an hour or so before you're actually left in darkness, and by that point it feels like you're in the middle of the ocean.<br><br>
	<center>

	By the time the starts have come out and the Milky Way is smeared across the sky, the shape of the mountains is gone and all you can see are the lights of Panaca to the north, twinkling from the 25 miles of air between your eyes and their source. Your nearest neighbour is the air force trailer to the south, which has an exterior light but never any overnight visitors. Every once in a while you can see a car in Utah driving west, and even though it's well over 50 miles away you feel like the driver can see you because of how bright their headlights are.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Hu1427P.png" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	That's not to say any of this makes me uneasy, it's just an experience unlike any other I've had. The only thought that ever gives me pause is the understanding that my position on the mountain and the fact that the windows on the tower go all the way around means that any light I produce can be seen for quite a distance.<br><br>
	It's kind of funny how during the day I spend my time looking out and keeping watch on the landscape, but how the coin flips and at nightfall I recognize that the tower is a sort of beacon with any light I put out. Not that anyone is watching (nor do I feel like the hills have eyes), but it's something I think about at least once every time the sun goes down, but by that point I'm usually too worried that the wind will carry me away and I'll be swallowed in the darkening sky.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/vNYlei6.png" width=90%><br><br>
	The sunrise is just as magnificent and starts early too. By 4 AM you can already see the lightening of the sky eastward. By 6 AM you're covering your head with the pillow because of how bright it is.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/GjHdoYp.png" width=90%><br>
	Being up with the sun gives me time to make a decent breakfast and take care of some chores before my shift officially starts at 8.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/vddEGNY.png" width=48%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/U6Kd1HW.png" width=42%><br>
	</center>
	I've been taking some time to make some headway on the weeds that have grown around the tower. In the image on the right you can see the difference (I tend to weed in the shade where it's still cool), they really have clogged up the place but it's worth it to clear them out.<br><br>
	So that's what's new at the tower! Overnight stays are truly amazing and it's nice to not have to drive so much back and forth. With water for washing and showering finally here (I keep 30 gallons of truly potable water for drinking and cooking), I'm finally all set for the season.<br><br>

	<h3>Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks</h3>
	<h4>2023.06.13 - 2023.06.14</h4>
	</center>
	We started seven day staffing which means a 12-on two-off schedule for each person. I had two days off and managed to get another pass to hike Angel's Landing so I went to Zion for Tuesday morning and then headed to Bryce Canyon for the rest of the afternoon and most of the day Wednesday.<br><br>
	I already have posts on Zion and Angel's Landing so I'll keep it brief before moving onto Bryce Canyon.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/uKSiwSn.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	Angel's Landing was a real treat this time because I was the second person up the chains but the first person to the actual overlook, where I had it to myself for a good ten to fifteen minutes. Starting early and going steadily up is definitely the way to go if you just want to feel the wind and soak in the canyon.<br><br>

	You can see how the grass can be problematic as it starts to cure. This is why a lot of people are suggesting a busy season towards the middle or end of the summer (and hey, the Fourth of July is only three weeks away).<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/xzurTpJ.png" width=28%><br>
	A stop to see the three patriarchs and then a quick view through a (heavily filtered) telescope near the visitor's center to look at the sun before I took on the Watchman's trail again.<br><br>

	Here are some cool geology shots for my friend Garett to look at and hopefully tell me what is going on here.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/bqdTdrU.png" width=90%><br>
	The above plant is skunkbush sumac (<i>Rhus trilobata</i>, Anacardiaceae), which I didn't even notice in flower the last times I was here.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/PQQmVdg.png" width=59%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/CGMbPv8.png" width=31%><br>
	</center>
	After the hike, I stopped by the visitor's center for some postcards, a stamp on my passport, and an interagency annual pass to access parks, national monuments, national forests, etc. It is an excellent value at $80 (and it has already paid for itself considering every time I've gone to a national park this summer I've snuck in before the gates opened and didn't have to pay...).<br><br>
	From the visitor's center, I took Highway 9 northeast up and out of Zion, including through the 1.1 mile Zion-Mount Carmel tunnel (no photographs while driving). Driving through that canyon out of the northeast of Zion really feels like you're going through canyons on another planet. The landscape was surreal and the path winding, and it was a very cool drive that had me stopping at every turnout or overlook I passed.<br><br>

	<h3></u>Bryce Canyon Park</h3></u>
	</center>
	I made it to Bryce Canyon in the mid-afternoon and had time to stop at the visitor's center and get a decent hike in. I was recommended given the time that the rim trail from Bryce Point to Sunrise Point would be an excellent place to start, especially as a first-time visitor.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/BeGekFu.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/kFggaEd.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ZmAoRS5.png" width=90%><br>
	The entire ride up to Bryce Point is deceiving. The park roads are situated on the rim to the west of the canyon itself, and while riding on the roads you wouldn't guess that there is a national park-worthy canyon within a hundred meters of you. The dominant trees are ponderosa pines and it feels almost like driving through a longleaf pine community back east.<br><br>

	<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AJFCJaUUizRh1KsY7yTPacB_WXaZisW9SkLHWm49M4VBZ412sd3OHqH3UQJXfjYk2EPv5dFwfdbjQd4bX9q7upfjkjXjqZvWS6pbwVC1lOkJxBjendzKaNIb=w11000" width=90%><br>
	Don't miss this panorama from Bryce Point! Zoom in in another tab and take a peek, to have that be my first view of the canyon was truly nutty. From Bryce Point I hiked to Sunrise Point, just under 3 miles of relatively-level trail.<br><br>
	
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/n2Ew2X0.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/eeAI8IY.png" width=45%><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/LgRqUFh.png" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/gVppOLG.png" width=90%><br>
	This first plant on the upper rim of the canyon is showy stoneseed (<i>Lithospermum incisum</i>, Boraginaceae), distinguished by the frilly edges of its petals.<br><br>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/1iZTDEg.png" width=90%><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/EDeFpv7.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/RBaR805.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	Another feature that makes it feel like you're in a longleaf pine forest is the presence of ericaceous shrubs! This one is greenleaf manzanita (<i>Arctostaphylos patula</i>, Ericaceae) and is incredibly common in the understory of the forests on the rim of the canyon.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/N0OFtjq.png" width=28%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/3OGWbrI.png" width=62%><br>
	Another yellow fellow is western wallflower (<i>Erysimum capitatum</i> var. <i>purshii</i>, Brassicaceae), which grows in nice patches under the trees.<br><br>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/UXT2bYE.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/nvWBjqv.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	Speaking of trees, there's a good mix! You'll find ponderosa (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>, Pinaceae), whose bark smells like butterscotch here rather than vanilla. Above is piñon pine (<i>Pinus edulis</i>, Pinaceae), whose seeds are quite large and are edible (you'll see them as pine nuts).<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/q9rFgW8.png" width=28%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/4KRnEYy.png" width=62%><br>
	</center>
	You'll also find Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>glauca</i>, Pinaceae), and the photos above show great basin bristlecone pine (<i>Pinus longaeva</i>, Pinaceae), a first time spot for me! I've been eager to find this plant since coming to this neck of the woods and while these aren't the oldest batch of trees, I hope to see them soon.<br>
	Note how the needles are in bundles of five - this is a trait that the white pines have, meaning this pine is a relative of our own eastern white pine (<i>Pinus strobus</i>, Pinaceae) in North Carolina.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/B6vWiBD.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/s2FzVrw.png" width=45%><br>
	The above flower is bitterweed (<i>Tetraneuris scaposa</i>, Asteraceae), and it grew right up the edge of the canyon.<br><br>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/2NFHp4s.png" width=45%>

	Another food blog moment: I stopped at the Bryce Canyon Lodge for dinner before catching the shuttle out of the park and am glad I did. It was a bit more expensive than the restaurant at Zion Lodge but the food was excellent and it was a nice sit-down experience. Through a happy accident my dessert was served first but it was just what I needed after a full day of hiking.<br><br>
	From there, it was a short drive to USFS land for a night of car camping.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ByReDvI.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ByQdNX3.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	I woke up very early to drive up to Rainbow Point but before doing that I stopped to watch the sunrise at Sunrise Point. I had maybe three minutes of sunlight before the sun ducked behind the clouds for the rest of the morning, so I certainly made it at just the right time.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/IcdHpf3.png" width=90%><br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/GsnP9v2.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/lQIn19f.png" width=45%><br>
	From there I drove along the scene drive up to Rainbow Point to do the Bristlecone Loop, and it was along this hike that I stood at the highest elevation I ever have before.<br><br>
	The air is definitely rare up here.<br><br>
	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/yQrr6Lg.png" width=90%><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/tDWjU22.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	Here's a new one as well - white fir (<i>Abies concolor</i>, Pinaceae). You can see the circular "suckers" where the leaves attach to the stem, a trait common amongst firs. Something you can see in the bottom photo is the presence of large blisters along the stem as it gets larger but before the bark shags over. These blisters hold resin and can be popped (onto your hiking companion if you can aim it right).<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/A5s39bP.png" width=66%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/XB13kki.png" width=29%><br>
	</center>
	While we're looking at leaf attachment in conifers, I mentioned that pines (great basin bristlecone pine above left) have "bundles", which are known as fascicles, where the leaves attach to the stem. Douglas-fir (above right) leaves have a small petiole, or stalk, where they attach to the leaves.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/xbyBnnU.png" width=62%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/UOIBKfm.png" width=28%><br>
	Some of these bristlecone pines were <i>gnarly</i>, but unfortunately many of the ones in this form were dead. I'm not sure what stressor killed them.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/joNJtSZ.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/JgM1sxN.png" width=45%><br>
	There was evidence of fire on one side of the trail, and these ponderosas tell the story there.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/ep2GS2E.png" width=90%><br>
	Here are some geology tidbits, a freebie for Garett.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/GAoGG9W.png" width=90%><br>
	On the way down from Rainbow Point, I stopped at some of the scenic overlooks. Natural Bridge is one such stop, and if you look to the left side of the photo you can see...<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/rl3ZUst.png" width=28%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Pf8797k.png" width=62%><br>	
	<img src="https://imgur.com/18opo0C.png" width=62%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/RzrFykE.png" width=28%><br>
	Quaking aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>, Salicaceae)! Look at those eyeball branch scars, I can only imagine what it's like to walk through an entire grove of them.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/bYM2TnW.png" width=90%><br>
	Another burn scar on the west side of the scenic drive.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/4ibF4rd.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ACj5ZD0.png" width=45%><br>
	As we get back closer to the visitor's center, you can see piles of slash/downed plant material every so often. These are set up with the intent to burn them individually in the winter when snow is on the ground to prevent the spread of fire. This is a way to use fire as a management tool to reduce the amount of fuels on the ground in areas where broadcast burning is harder to due for fear of spreading.<br><br>

	<img src="https://imgur.com/VaaCTtu.png" width=62%><br>
	I drove out of the park to the shuttle station to catch a ride back in, where I went to the Lodge once again before starting the day's hikes.<br><br>

	The hike for the day was the Queens Garden - Navajo Trail combined loop. I took my time going through and it was wonderful to go into the canyon I had only viewed from above so far. Here are some of the photos from the hike, presented without much comment.<br><br>

	Bryce Canyon is famous for its phenomenal geologic structures called "hoodoos", which means to "bewitch". Hoodoos are formed as water and wind erode the soft sandstone, and Bryce Canyon has the highest density and abundance of hoodoos in the world.<br><br>

	As you head up the canyon again on the Navajo trail, you find Douglas-firs! I'm amazed at how large they are (I'm standing next to one!) and how they come right out of the rock.<br><br>

	I was asked why you shouldn't build cairns, especially in rivers or near bodies of water. Lots of little critters like to live and hang out under rocks, and building cairns takes away that real estate from them and it is a sort of signal to others that it's okay to manipulate the area.<br><br>

	When you do the combined loop of Queens Garden and the Navajo Trail, you have to choose one side of the Navajo trail to go up. I decided to do just the Navajo loop one more time to see both sides.<br><br>

	All day I was looking forward to trying Valhalla pizza only to walk up and find they were closed! A bummer, so I stopped into the lodge once again for lunch. Between the Zion and the Bryce Canyon visitor centers I had a hefty stack of postcards that needed to be written (if you'd like one, let me know!).<br><br>

	After writing some at lunch, I spent some time writing the rest of the postcards on the rim of the canyon before sitting for a bit and taking one last look. It was a nice way to spend an hour, and with a stack of 25 stamped and addressed, I headed towards the visitor's center to mail them before leaving.<br><br>

	I'll spend a little time gushing about the shuttle system here. While the shuttle doesn't go all the way to Rainbow Point (it mostly stays on the rim of the main canyon), it has many stops for most of the hikes you could do while at Bryce Canyon Park.<br><br>
	It's a free shuttle with stops both in and out of the park, and it's a great way to reduce congestion within the park. Similar to Zion, I can only imagine just how jammed the roads could be without the shuttle, if everyone had to take their car into the park.<br><br>

	Another stamp for today's visit to the park and I was once again Nevada-bound.<br><br>
