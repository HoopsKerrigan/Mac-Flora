<h2>Wheeler Peak</h2>
	<h4>2023.09.10</h4>
	</center>
	I finally had a chance to do the Wheeler Peak hike, just a couple of weeks before the end of my stint in Nevada. I've wanted to do it since I first drove by on the way to Ely for orientation back in May.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9qKNeuo.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	Wheeler Peak is the second highest peak in Nevada, standing at 13,065 feet, behind Boundary Peak at 13,147 feet. However, Boundary Peak is a shoulder summit of Montgomery Peak in California whereas Wheeler Peak is the tallest standalone peak in the state, so take that as you will. Wheeler peak is a prominence of over 7000 feet from the surrounding basin, but the hike starts at an elevation just under 10,000 feet, saving us some legwork.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mh9suAm.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/o2P8kIa.jpg" width=100%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oAmiGjU.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	The hike starts in a lovely grove of aspens (<i>Populus</i> sp., Salicace), and takes you steadily uphill through the grove before breaking into a few sections of grassy meadow. The entire time, Wheeler peak looms sturdily overhead as you make your way up the trail.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7FGcS6N.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lPrZDPw.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZBbg7uD.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	The meadow eventually gives way to steeper, rougher, and rockier hillside at a near 45-degree grade. It is here where grass gives way to blooms, and you can find such lovely plants as the following:<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0SHc82Z.jpg" width=100%><br>
	Mountain monardella (<i>Monardella odoratissima</i>, Lamiaceae), also known as coyote mint.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JkQpp1g.jpg" width=49%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rphu2K3.jpeg" width=49%><br>
	What I believe to be smoothleaf penstemon (<i>Pensetemon leiophyllus</i>, Plantaginaceae).<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2iEk5d7.jpeg" width=100%><br>
	Between the violet blooms popped some kind of rabbitbrush (<i>Chrysothamnus</i> sp., Asteraceae) with brilliant yellow.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qhnG1kY.jpg" width=100%><br>
	Some kind of blackberry (<i>Rubus</i> sp., Rosaceae).<br><br>
	</center>
	Such blooms continue throughout the thinning tree cover until you come up to the end of mile three on the trial, where the trees get shorter and more spaced until the treeline ends abruptly at around 11,500 feet - a phenomena I loved to experience.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2iEk5d7.jpeg" width=100%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/64ltY1y.jpeg" width=100%><br>
	What looks to be some kind of cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla</i> sp., Rosaceae). These grew past the other blossoms, right to the treeline.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iZN5TIj.jpg" width=100%><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LdxgfoH.jpg" width=100% title="The last tree!"><br><br>
	</center>
	The last tree! This marked the first occasion on which I walked past the treeline on my own two feet and it was pretty fun to say goodbye to trees for a while. Past the treeline, it's about another mile up to the peak, but the last mile took about as long as the first three. It's like a switch flipped and the elevation starts to affect your stamina, so it's important to take breaks, drink water, and know your limits so as not to put yourself in danger.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KP2Nfq4.jpg" width=100%><br>
	</center>
	A fun plant to see here, way above the treeline, was Parry's primrose (<i>Primula parryi</i>, Primulaceae). This plant can be found along the streams feeding into Lake Teresa and other lakes in the park.<br><br>
	Eventually you reach the top and have a 360-degree view of the surrounding landscape, a truly beautiful spread of the Nevada landscape. Below you, the glacier rests above a grove of Bristlecone pines.<br><br>
	<center>

	I suggest opening this in another tab and zooming in on this near-360-degree view from Wheeler peak.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2oTZVOc.jpg" width=49%><br><br>
	The peak serves as one of the best lunch spots in the state, and it was there that I "enjoyed" a crummy MRE Pizza. Review coming soon.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9qKNeuo.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	Wheeler Peak was a challenging and rewarding hike. The challenge is twofold and really picks up in the latter half of your hike, as you have your steepest parts of the trail above the treeline, where you feel the greatest effect of high elevation.<br><br>

	Following this hike, I went back to the grove of bristlecones and romped around, looking for the stump of Prometheus (more on that later). Despite the search being unsuccessful, it was a wonderful day at Great Basin, and of course there were postcards that went out as well.<br><br>

<h2>Winterizing Ella Mountain - Retrospective</h2>
	<h4>2023.09.14</h4>
	<img src="">
	</center>
	Just as quickly as it started, the time has come to winterize Ella Mountain. Four months to the day that I first came to Nevada, I prep to leave and of course there is a mix of emotions. This post doesn't detail anything but is more a personal writeup of my summer on the peak.<br><br>
	I feel so grateful to have been able to spend four months up on Ella, as being a fire lookout is a job that has interested me since I was about 12 years old and is one of the jobs that actually got me interested in natural resources as a career path. To finally have been able to spend a summer up in a tower is a dream come true.

<h2>Prometheus</h2>
	<h4>2023.09.15</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2criQWd.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	The stump of what was once the oldest tree on earth has been on my mind long before I actually came to Nevada, and being so close to Great Basin Park has only increased my interest in finding it. I had done a search for the stump every time I visited, going off of incorrect information from the internet, hopeful searches by satellite, asking park rangers (without answer), and off-trail hiking. None of these methods gave any answer, but as my end date in Nevada drew nearer I began to reach out to different people who may have some authority to disclose the location of the stump of Prometheus.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PJcZZjU.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	Pestering or persistence, whichever you decide to call it, it finally paid off! I was bounced from person to person on the phone over the course of a week (all of whom will remain unnamed) before a lengthy conversation about my intentions, background, expectations, etc. with someone who ended up emailing me the coordinates. The reason for secrecy surrounding the stump's location is the fact that visitors tend to want to take or otherwise vandalize the stump, and the long discussion I had with that last person was mostly for them to gauge whether or not I'd be someone who can be trusted with the location of the stump.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gYKsm6M.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	I have already given the short version of the story of why this is a stump and not a living tree – for a refresher, you can look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(tree)">here</a> or <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grba/planyourvisit/identifying-bristlecone-pines.htm">here</a>. It's a sad one, but I don't personally hold Currey accountable given the fact that a grad student is likely not the one to make a call on whether an ancient tree is cut down.<br><br>
	<u>I will <b>not</b> disclose the location of Prometheus, nor will I give hints to its location – that information is not mine to share.</u> If you'd like to see it, go do some digging and start making some phone calls.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JprleYH.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	My journey to Prometheus started in Caliente –  I decided to add six hours driving (and several hours hiking) to my trip out of Nevada following the end of my season on Ella. I am not too keen on driving but this was worth the extra mileage. If you look closely and with a keen eye, you can see the Ella mountain lookout and radio repeaters on the ridgeline – this was my last view of Ella, taken just before going out of view as I drove north.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IZJYR0p.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	I was told about previous vandalism and removal of parts of the stump in the past, but as soon as I was near the tree I didn't even feel like it was okay to touch it. It's a tree stump, something so mundane and commonplace that it shouldn't be worth it to make a detour for, but the presence that surrounded the stump of Prometheus was palpable. I was surprised to find that the bulk of the tree was still there on the ground where it was felled over 60 years ago – doing some reading later I found that the largest pieces taken were slabs, one of which is in the Great Basin National Park Visitor Center, one is in the Bristlecone Pine Visitor's Center in Ely, NV (where my orientation was held in May), and one is in the possession of the University of Arizona, Tuscon, for study.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9hruCNH.png" width=60%><br>
	Here, I've attempted to map the location of the largest parts of what remains of Prometheus (not to scale/not done with formal measurements).<br><br>
	</center>
	Looking around parts of the tree, you can find marks left from when the tree was cut. The large, flat faces of the cuts are the most stark, but there are also wedges cut from different sections, places where the chainsaw entered but didn't make a complete cut, and even the borehole from the increment borers Currey was using on the tree. The fact that the face of the cut goes directly into a borehole gives some salt to the theory that he got at least one of his increment borers stuck while trying to age it.<br><br>

	I spent about an hour or so by Prometheus, and I think it was just about the perfect send off to the boreal summer. I left Nevada just before the sun started to set, both on the landscape and on this chapter.<br><br>

	Next stop, the bottom of the world.<br><br>

<h2>Petrified Forest National Park</h2>
	<h4>2023.09.16</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/h0vSXqq.jpeg" width=100% title="A view of the painted desert – I highly recommend zooming in on this panorama."><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KkOMpMe.jpg" width=100% title="This one too!"><br><br>
	</center>
	But not yet! There are a few more stops between Nevada and Antarctica, the first of which is Petrified Forest National Park. This park is right off of interstate 40 in Arizona, directly on my route back east after Nevada. I didn't stop for too long but had a chance to take a quick walk with a ranger into one of the canyons.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qCVcRXJ.jpg" width=100%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MFKmjHB.jpg" width=100%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oNef9AR.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	There are currently at least nine species of fossilised tree that have been described within the park, the most abundant being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucarioxylon_arizonicum"><i>Araucarioxylon arizonicum</i> (Araucariaceae)</a>, a Jurassic conifer that lived ~220 million years ago. This petrified wood is an example of petrification, a process where minerals replace the original organic material while filling in cavities and remove the ability to study internal structure of the plant. However, a fraction of the fossils within the park are permineralized, a process where internal casts are formed through deposition of mineral material carried by water. Permineralized fossilization retains internal structure down to the cellular level and allow for study of past plant internal anatomy.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Araucarioxylon_arizonicum_reconstruccion.jpg" width=50%><br><br>
	</center>
	Above is an illustration of a full recreation of <i>Araucarioxylon arizonicum</i> (Falconaumanni, Wikimedia Commons). An extinct conifer, it was likely a bottomland-dwelling species whose fossilized specimens were likely preserved underwater or in riverbeds while fossilization occurred. Living during the Triassic period, it is estimated this tree grew up to 200 feet tall and 2 feet in diameter.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9sC5cmu.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	As these logs fossilize, they are buried by sediments over millions of years before being exposed again due to erosion and uplift events. The fossils are able to be exposed due to the fact that they are harder than the surrounding sediments, and they often fracture into shorter segments during such exposure. As the ranger put it: "if you put a peppermint stick between two pillows and sit on it, the pillows squish but the candy cane doesn't, and it breaks into chunks." It is the lack of compressibility that causes the fossilized logs to break as they do.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://www.nps.gov/pefo/images/Petrified-Wood-Levels-geo-strat.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false&quality=78&format=webp" width=75%><br><br>
	</center>
	Above is an illustration (NPS) detailing the layers of rock within the park and where certain layers are exposed at different areas. A majority of the park and petrified wood comes from the Chinle formation, dating to the Jurassic period.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ODCf3uE.jpg" width=100%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zZhBTpO.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	The above log had several interesting bits of history that could be deduced from its physical properties and its location. Most apparent is the presence of numerous little holes on the log – these are insect bore holes, 220 million years old and preserved during the petrification process!<br><br>
	Also present (but not as clearly seen) on the left side of the above image is evidence of fire scarring, a unique part of the history of this log but also an interesting one, given that these trees are thought to have grown in bottomlands where fire would be much less common. It is observed in living trees that some insect species will attack trees that are stressed, and it's possible that this was the case with this particular tree; the fire stressed the tree and made it susceptible to insect infestation.<br><br>
	A more recent addition to this log's story is the fact that evidence suggests it is upside-down! This was likely caused by humans, who would have moved the log to make way for a roadway, back in the early 1900s when this particular part of the park was open to vehicles driving down into the canyon. Thankfully that doesn't happen anymore.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gDh7tfl.jpg" width=100%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qQobO2m.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	The above log fragments also have an interesting feature. Most of the logs found within the park are all xylem tissue (inddards) - no phloem (bark tissue/outards). While not all of the cobbly texture is bark, there is bark tissue contained within that conglomeration! Not necessarily the most impossible find in the park but definitely a small fraction of petrified specimens.
	<center>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qGFimGT.jpg" width=100%"><br><br>
	</center>
	All throughout these valleys are found shards of petrified logs and rocks with fragments broken off – these are all indicators of the people who lived in the area that Petrified Forest park now exists upon. Evidence suggests people living in the area as much as 13,000 years ago with several distinct periods of habitation over these millenia. These rock fragments and shards of petrified logs are evidence of toolmaking, and a valley littered with fragments suggests millenia of such practice.<br><br>
	However, the story of the Lithic peoples and Puebo indigenous peoples is not mine to tell. I felt the park did a good job of sharing not only the geologic phenomena of petrified wood but also the history of the people who lived there long before the park was established. The <a href="https://www.nps.gov/pefo/learn/historyculture/paleo-people.htm">NPS website has a page detailing the different periods of habitation</a> as well as <a href="https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?pg=1830525&id=10E8D1A8-7525-4F18-9F96-DEAB2D83E377">a photo gallery of their legacy</a>, but I suggest further reading if you are interested.<br><br>
	I wish I had had more time to spend in this park to really soak it in, but I was in a rush to get back east before the big hop south. Once again, postcards and a cancellation to wrap up this park.<br><br>

<h2>Mt. Mitchell, Base to Peak</h2>
	<h4>2023.09.21</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1mGlEkr.jpg" width=100%><br><br>
	</center>
	Back in North Carolina! I wanted to squeeze in my favourite hike before I said goodbye to greenery for a while, and I went with my good friend Leigha for a botanizing hike. I had intended to do it before Nevada before my car bit the dust in May, so I'm glad to have gotten the chance to do it before Antarctica.<br><br>
	There are more photos of the plants I had been missing all summer than scenic views, so if you're here for plants I hope you enjoy. The trail starts at the base of Mt. Mitchell at the Black Mountain and makes its way up to the top of Mount Mitchell, the tallest North American peak east of the Mississippi. From bottom to top and back down again it takes 6 or 7 hours, and it's my favourite hike as you can see transisition in forest type from mixed hardwood to heath-oak to spruce-fir to fir.<br><br>
	In no particular order of appearance, here are some of the plants seen along the walk! I neglected to note community type or elevation of incidence for any of these. Forgive and notify me of any misidentifications, as it has been a while since I took these.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FtVWrN4.jpg" width=100%><br>
	Running clubmoss (<i>Lycopodium clavatum</i>, Lycopodiaceae) grew among the above as well, though in lesser quantity.<br><br>

	American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>, Fagaceae) peeks out here and there!<br><br>

	We begin to see rock tripe (<i>Umbilicaria</i> sp., Umbrilicariaceae) as rock outcrops become more common in higher elevations.<br><br>

	What I believe* to be deerberry (<i>Vaccinium stamineum</i> var. <i>stamineum</i>, Ericaceae). Fruit was fairly abundant as we hiked.<br>
	<font size = 2>*This identification is six months after the observation, using limited photos, while in Antarctica.</font><br><br>

	The larger outcrops didn't stop trees from growing around them, and some went to the absolute extreme growing on top. You may have heard the term "nurse logs", these seem to be cases of "nurse rocks".<br><br>

	This lichen is lungwort (<i>Lobaria pulmonaria</i>, Peltigeraceae, Kingdom Fungi) and it has the fun property of rehydrating to a vibrant green! When we stumbled upon it, it was a dull green-grey, but pouring water upon it yielded a very quick transition to bright green as it rehydrated. I don't have a before/after, but you can see the change in the upper and lower parts of the photograph.<br><br>

	Time makes the heart grow fonder but it does not making IDing unknown bryophytes easier.<br><br>

	Eventually, you reach the highest parts of the trail as you transition from red spruce (<i>Picea rubens</i>, Pinaceae, the tall trees in the right of the photograph above) to spruce-fir and eventually Fraser fir (<i>Abies fraseri</i>, Pinaceae, photographed below).<br><br>

	It's in these higher elevation areas where you can find such species as:<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W73SwLM.jpg" width=100%><br>
	Mountain woodsorrel (<i>Oxalis montana</i>, Oxalidaceae – NOT a clover!)<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yhXPyoN.jpg" width=100%><br>
	Kidneyleaf grass-of-parnassus (<i>Parnassia asarifolia</i>, Parnassiaceae).<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JzGhlFW.jpg" width=60%><br>
	Yellow birch (<i>Betula allegheniensis</i>, Betulaceae), foliage not accessible.<br><br>

	American raspberry (<i>Rubus strigosus</i>, Rosaceae) in abundance, though only some bearing fruit.<br><br>

	And eventually, the top!<br><br>

	This hike is my favourite hike, period. The photographs here are only a snapshot of the diversity present along the trail as you make over 3000 feet of elevation gain before turning around and seeing it in reverse. I hope one day to do a more in-depth look at the flora and communities present and how they bleed together.<br><br>

	This is it for North American plants for a while! From here, it's the big leap south!<br><br>
	Thank you for reading (if you made it this far)!<br><br>
