<h2>Hut Ridge Loop</h2>
	<h4>November 5, 2023</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LBBfdD2.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	One of the longer hikes you can do as part of the Ross Island Trail system takes you out of town for a moment near some of the radar domes at Arrival Heights before going down a spine ridge to Hut Point. This hike offers some solid elevation gain, serious winds, and a good view of town opposite <a href="https://macflora.net/October23.html#Oct236">Observation Hill</a>.<br><br>
	You can do this loop either way, but this trip details the anti-clockwise route.<br><br>
	You start off in town, and need to obtain a radio and check out with the firehouse for this hike. From 155, you head north past the waste barn and continue up the inclined road past a row of MILVAN containers.<br><br>
	<center>

	Forwards backwards.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	As the road begins to curve west, it's at a junction here where you can turn off to hike Castle Rock, another trail on the island. Continuing left, you instead find yourself near the start of Arrival Heights, where a number of satellite domes are situated.<br><br>

	</center>
	Easing past them, you cross a valley before coming up to the highest point of your hike, which also is where some high winds can be found. This is a good spot to try and lean into the wind, which often blows in excess of 40 MPH on the windward side. If you're looking for more quiet, you can walk a few steps to the leeward side and sit in completely still air as the wind rips directly overhead.<br><br>

	From here, you turn southeast and make your way down the ridge towards hut point, the location of Discovery hut.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ay3OXNB.jpeg" width=70%><br>
	<font size="2">From a ways up, you can see Discovery Hut and Hut Point.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9vOcpev.jpeg" width=45%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9vUa8C7.jpeg" width=45%><br>
	Some more of those <a href="https://macflora.net/October23.html#Oct237">geodetic markers</a> I mentioned, along the way.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/A1uJYKr.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	Looking back up the ridge.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	I'll save Hut Point for another, more in-depth post but it's here where the hut was built in 1902 by the 1901-1904 Discovery Expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott. Hut point is a great place to get just a little bit out of town for a good spot to sit and ponder.<br><br>

	<font size="2">Discovery Hut, with downtown McMurdo and Ob Hill in the background.<br><br></font>
	</center>
	From here, it's a quick walk back into town where you started. All told, Hut Ridge Loop takes a little under 2 hours and offers some good views of town and beyond, even if it is more than a little windy.<br><br>

<h2>Condition Fun - An Introduction to Antarctic Weather</h2>

	</center>
	About a week after becoming the Willy Sous Chef but before the New York Air National Guard (NYANG) arrived, we had a run-in with some intense Antarctic weather: Condition 1.<br><br>
	Monitoring weather on the ice is a very vital part of operations there, but for outdoor weather at a glance you take a look at the current Condition. Given the variability of weather in Antarctica and the ability for weather to change in a very short timeframe, being able to get an idea of what conditions may be like and what outdoor restrictions may or may not be in effect is easier than knowing the specifics.<br><br>
	McMurdo Station uses three states: Condition 3, Condition 2, and Condition 1. These categories are broken down based on three criteria: wind speed, visibility, and temperature. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica_Weather_Danger_Classification">From Wikipedia</a>:<br><br>

	</tbody></table>
	<br><br>
	With each condition level, there are certain restrictions on outdoor activity put in place to keep people safe. From <a href="https://www.usap.gov/USAPgov/travelAndDeployment/documents/FieldManual-Chapt10Weather.pdf">Chapter 10</a> of the 2024 Field Manual for the U.S. Antarctic Program:<br><br>
	<b><u>Condition 3</u></b>: Unrestricted travel and activity are allowed.<br><br>
	<b><u>Condition 2</u></b>: Restricted pedestrian traffic only between buildings is allowed. Vehicular travel is allowed if radio equipped, enclosed vehicles only, and check out is required.<br><br>
	<b><u>Condition 1</u></b>: Severe weather is in progress. All personnel must remain in buildings or the nearest shelter.<br><br>
	I've made a chart to break it down visually. You can see that both wind and temperature have the most leeway before Condition 2 is called, whereas Visibility is of greatest concern.<br><br>

	Every vestibule and some central hubs have dot-display LED panels for displaying the current condition so people headed outdoors knew what to prepare for. The area outside of the Building 155 Galley has a television constantly displaying the Conditions of town and all near-field sites. This information was also available on the McMurdo intranet homepage.<br><br>
	<center>

	Downtown McMurdo sits in a sort of geographic bowl, sheltered from the prevaling winds on three sides. Areas on the ridgetops (T-Site, Arrival Heights, Scott Base, Road to Scott Base) and ice shelf (Phoenix Field, Road to Phoenix Field, Sea Ice, LDB Site, Williams Field) are more exposed to the weather and as such tend to reach Condition 2 or 1 before McMurdo does.<br><br>
	I've been told that "Condition 3 doesn't mean good weather, it just means 'safe for now' weather." A good 90% of the summer season is spent in Condition 3, but the difference in temperatures and especially wind speed did mean the difference between some light layering and bundling up.<br><br>
	That bit about "All personnel must remain in buildings" holds true even while in town, and doesn't offer exceptions for things like eating – it was recommended, especially at the shoulders of mainbody, for those who lived in dorms outside of Building 155 (the building with the Galley) to keep some food in their bedrooms in case the weather ever prevented them from making a mealtime. When it hit Con 2 in town, you would notice more people wrapping plates or pocketing Grab 'n' Go items to take back with them in case the weather got worse. It almost reminds you of the old addage "it's time to get the bread and milk" when it starts to snow.<br><br>

	If you're cold, they're cold. Bring them inside.<br><br>
	</center>
	That's the rundown on the Condition categories of weather at McMurdo, now onto our Condition 1 day out at Willy field. Only about 9 people were working at the airfield that morning, myself and a dining steward included. At around 9 AM, shuttles said they were headed back to town and to call if we needed a ride as regular services were being suspended due to it being Condition 2. By 1145 AM with all Willy workers in the galley, Condition 1 was called on the ice shelf. We were told to shelter in place and were completely safe inside the galley, and the limited service meant we had ample time to watch the weather deteriorate and subsequently improve over the course of the day. Search and Rescue (SAR) was mobilized and we were picked up in a Bandvagn 206 (though everyone just calls them Hägglunds), arriving in town around dinnertime.<br><br>
	I'll stop rambling now and share all of the cool photographs, videos, and sounds I took during Conditions 1 and 2. Most of the videos have sound, and beware of the fact that some of them are <b>loud</b> in the wind. I have more gnarly weather that came at the end of the season, but I'll save that for a later post. Enjoy, and I'll catch you on the flip flop.<br><br>

<h2>The Crary Touch Tank</h2>
	<h4>November 12, 2023</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NrXlBTB.jpg" width=70%><br><br>
	</center>
 	Quick little post here about a neat part of Crary Laboratories. Crary (designated building 001) is a hub for scientific activity on station, and there are a number of offices and laboratories present throughout the three levels of the building. A fun little exhibit that ran for a short while on Level 3 was the touch tank.<br><br>
	The touch tank is part of the Crary lab indoor study tanks for the creatures that live in Antarctic waters. Seatwater is pumped directly into the water tanks here in Crary to simulate the environment of these critters, where they can be studied up close and in a more accessible environment.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Oe8QFDR.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<font size="2">The touch tank, full of critters.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	The touch tank itself was off to the side from the larger holding tanks, and was a nice little concentrated taste of undersea life in Antarctic waters. The larger tanks took up the bulk of the room. The water is <i>dreadfully</i> cold when you stick your hands in.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kl43iMM.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<font size="2">One of the larger study tanks.<br><br></font>
	</center>
	I've included photos of the informative booklet they had on display, but some highlights: The water is kept at 28°F. Many Antarctic aquatic species display polar gigantism, a phenomenon where species adapted for colder waters are much larger than their temperare counterparts. Most of these creatures survive these frigid waters by utilizing some form or another of biological antifreeze in their systems.<br><br>

	Now onto the critters:<br><br>
