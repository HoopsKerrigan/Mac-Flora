<h2>Hut Ridge Loop</h2>
	<h4>November 5, 2023</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LBBfdD2.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	One of the longer hikes you can do as part of the Ross Island Trail system takes you out of town for a moment near some of the radar domes at Arrival Heights before going down a spine ridge to Hut Point. This hike offers some solid elevation gain, serious winds, and a good view of town opposite <a href="https://macflora.net/October23.html#Oct236">Observation Hill</a>.<br><br>
	You can do this loop either way, but this trip details the anti-clockwise route.<br><br>
	You start off in town, and need to obtain a radio and check out with the firehouse for this hike. From 155, you head north past the waste barn and continue up the inclined road past a row of MILVAN containers.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4cimZrH.jpg" width=37.5%><br>
	Forwards backwards.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	As the road begins to curve west, it's at a junction here where you can turn off to hike Castle Rock, another trail on the island. Continuing left, you instead find yourself near the start of Arrival Heights, where a number of satellite domes are situated.<br><br>

	A 15-foot diameter satellite dish sits inside!</font><br><br>
	</center>
	Easing past them, you cross a valley before coming up to the highest point of your hike, which also is where some high winds can be found. This is a good spot to try and lean into the wind, which often blows in excess of 40 MPH on the windward side. If you're looking for more quiet, you can walk a few steps to the leeward side and sit in completely still air as the wind rips directly overhead.<br><br>

	From here, you turn southeast and make your way down the ridge towards hut point, the location of Discovery hut.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ay3OXNB.jpeg" width=70%><br>
	<font size="2">From a ways up, you can see Discovery Hut and Hut Point.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9vOcpev.jpeg" width=45%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9vUa8C7.jpeg" width=45%><br>
	Some more of those <a href="https://macflora.net/October23.html#Oct237">geodetic markers</a> I mentioned, along the way.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/A1uJYKr.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	Looking back up the ridge.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	I'll save Hut Point for another, more in-depth post but it's here where the hut was built in 1902 by the 1901-1904 Discovery Expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott. Hut point is a great place to get just a little bit out of town for a good spot to sit and ponder.<br><br>

	<font size="2">Discovery Hut, with downtown McMurdo and Ob Hill in the background.<br><br></font>
	</center>
	From here, it's a quick walk back into town where you started. All told, Hut Ridge Loop takes a little under 2 hours and offers some good views of town and beyond, even if it is more than a little windy.<br><br>

<h2>Condition Fun - An Introduction to Antarctic Weather</h2>

	</center>
	About a week after becoming the Willy Sous Chef but before the New York Air National Guard (NYANG) arrived, we had a run-in with some intense Antarctic weather: Condition 1.<br><br>
	Monitoring weather on the ice is a very vital part of operations there, but for outdoor weather at a glance you take a look at the current Condition. Given the variability of weather in Antarctica and the ability for weather to change in a very short timeframe, being able to get an idea of what conditions may be like and what outdoor restrictions may or may not be in effect is easier than knowing the specifics.<br><br>
	McMurdo Station uses three states: Condition 3, Condition 2, and Condition 1. These categories are broken down based on three criteria: wind speed, visibility, and temperature. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica_Weather_Danger_Classification">From Wikipedia</a>:<br><br>

	</tbody></table>
	<br><br>
	With each condition level, there are certain restrictions on outdoor activity put in place to keep people safe. From <a href="https://www.usap.gov/USAPgov/travelAndDeployment/documents/FieldManual-Chapt10Weather.pdf">Chapter 10</a> of the 2024 Field Manual for the U.S. Antarctic Program:<br><br>
	<b><u>Condition 3</u></b>: Unrestricted travel and activity are allowed.<br><br>
	<b><u>Condition 2</u></b>: Restricted pedestrian traffic only between buildings is allowed. Vehicular travel is allowed if radio equipped, enclosed vehicles only, and check out is required.<br><br>
	<b><u>Condition 1</u></b>: Severe weather is in progress. All personnel must remain in buildings or the nearest shelter.<br><br>
	I've made a chart to break it down visually. You can see that both wind and temperature have the most leeway before Condition 2 is called, whereas Visibility is of greatest concern.<br><br>

	</center>
	Every vestibule and some central hubs have dot-display LED panels for displaying the current condition so people headed outdoors knew what to prepare for. The area outside of the Building 155 Galley has a television constantly displaying the Conditions of town and all near-field sites. This information was also available on the McMurdo intranet homepage.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FNPOR5X.gif" width=90%><br><br>

	Downtown McMurdo sits in a sort of geographic bowl, sheltered from the prevaling winds on three sides. Areas on the ridgetops (T-Site, Arrival Heights, Scott Base, Road to Scott Base) and ice shelf (Phoenix Field, Road to Phoenix Field, Sea Ice, LDB Site, Williams Field) are more exposed to the weather and as such tend to reach Condition 2 or 1 before McMurdo does.<br><br>
	I've been told that "Condition 3 doesn't mean good weather, it just means 'safe for now' weather." A good 90% of the summer season is spent in Condition 3, but the difference in temperatures and especially wind speed did mean the difference between some light layering and bundling up.<br><br>
	That bit about "All personnel must remain in buildings" holds true even while in town, and doesn't offer exceptions for things like eating – it was recommended, especially at the shoulders of mainbody, for those who lived in dorms outside of Building 155 (the building with the Galley) to keep some food in their bedrooms in case the weather ever prevented them from making a mealtime. When it hit Con 2 in town, you would notice more people wrapping plates or pocketing Grab 'n' Go items to take back with them in case the weather got worse. It almost reminds you of the old addage "it's time to get the bread and milk" when it starts to snow.<br><br>

	If you're cold, they're cold. Bring them inside.<br><br>
	</center>
	That's the rundown on the Condition categories of weather at McMurdo, now onto our Condition 1 day out at Willy field. Only about 9 people were working at the airfield that morning, myself and a dining steward included. At around 9 AM, shuttles said they were headed back to town and to call if we needed a ride as regular services were being suspended due to it being Condition 2. By 1145 AM with all Willy workers in the galley, Condition 1 was called on the ice shelf. We were told to shelter in place and were completely safe inside the galley, and the limited service meant we had ample time to watch the weather deteriorate and subsequently improve over the course of the day. Search and Rescue (SAR) was mobilized and we were picked up in a Bandvagn 206 (though everyone just calls them Hägglunds), arriving in town around dinnertime.<br><br>
	I'll stop rambling now and share all of the cool photographs, videos, and sounds I took during Conditions 1 and 2. Most of the videos have sound, and beware of the fact that some of them are <b>loud</b> in the wind. I have more gnarly weather that came at the end of the season, but I'll save that for a later post. Enjoy, and I'll catch you on the flip flop.<br><br>

<h2>The Crary Touch Tank</h2>
	<h4>November 11, 2023</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NrXlBTB.jpg" width=70%><br><br>
	</center>
 	Quick little post here about a neat part of Crary Laboratories. Crary (designated building 001) is a hub for scientific activity on station, and there are a number of offices and laboratories present throughout the three levels of the building. A fun little exhibit that ran for a short while on Level 3 was the touch tank.<br><br>
	The touch tank is part of the Crary lab indoor study tanks for the creatures that live in Antarctic waters. Seatwater is pumped directly into the water tanks here in Crary to simulate the environment of these critters, where they can be studied up close and in a more accessible environment.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Oe8QFDR.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<font size="2">The touch tank, full of critters.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	The touch tank itself was off to the side from the larger holding tanks, and was a nice little concentrated taste of undersea life in Antarctic waters. The larger tanks took up the bulk of the room. The water is <i>dreadfully</i> cold when you stick your hands in.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kl43iMM.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<font size="2">One of the larger study tanks.<br><br></font>
	</center>
	I've included photos of the informative booklet they had on display, but some highlights: The water is kept at 28°F. Many Antarctic aquatic species display polar gigantism, a phenomenon where species adapted for colder waters are much larger than their temperare counterparts. Most of these creatures survive these frigid waters by utilizing some form or another of biological antifreeze in their systems.<br><br>

	Now onto the critters:<br><br>

<h2>Castle Rock Loop</h2>
	<h4>November 12, 2023</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nkSA0kt.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	This post details one of the longest hikes on station: Castle Rock Hike. Without completing any offshoot trails, this hike tops out around 10 miles long and can take up to four hours to complete. It's a great way to spend the day out of town while seeing across parts of Ross Island you don't normally see.<br><br>
	This is a hike for which you need to file an eFoot Plan with the fire station - this is simply a plan that lets them know who you are, who you are with, what hike you plan to do, and your estimated time of return (ETR). If you don't check back in with the firehouse by the time of your ETR, they first give you a phone call and then your contact number. If within five minutes after your ETR you still haven't showed up, the search and rescue (SAR) team is mobilized to try and find you.<br><br>
	The trail starts much the same way as <a href="https://macflora.net/November23.html#Nov230">Hut Ridge Loop</a> and shares the same path out of town. When you come across this sign, you instead continue to the right rather than to the left.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fFbpqsx.jpeg" width=70%><br><br>
 	</center>
	After coming a bit out of the ridge, you find yourself at the foot of an ice field. This field is slightly uphill the whole way and (in early November) as slick as can be and very gusty from down slope winds. There were many instances of sliding on backwards on your feet, pushed by the wind.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/o4TZNM8.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<font size="2">Looking forward.<br><br>

	Looking backwards towards town (Can you spot <a href="https://macflora.net/October23.html#Oct236">Observation Hill</a>?).</font><br><br>
	</center>
	You may have spotted it in the "Looking forward" photograph above, but there are two small, insulated shelters on the way to Castle Rock known as "apples". These are in place for hikers who get caught when bad weather quickly moves in. The first one (Apple 1, pictured below), is located at the end of the first ice field, roughly halfway between town and Castle Rock itself. It's a good place to take a breather, drink some water, and have a snack.<br><br>
	While you are meant to plan for weather, carry your own extreme cold weather gear, and pack your own food and water for the hike, these apples are also supplied with things like blankets, first aid kits, a fire extinguisher, and toilet paper should you be caught in poor weather and need to shelter in place for a while.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Munrzly.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	It's about here that you can look to the northeast and see both LDB Site and Williams Airfield as tiny specks on the ice shelf.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8BtPYp7.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	Castle Rock sits ahead, still dwarfed by Mount Erebus.<br><br></font></center>
	After another stretch on less-treacherous ice than before, you come to the second apple near the base of Castle Rock. This one is slightly larger, being further away from town, but like the first one it is unheated.<br><br>

	</center>
	Castle Rock does have a trail leading to the top that is guided by ropes to help prevent falls. However, we went too early in the season and as such the rope trail was not set up and the trail was closed. brr.fyi details the trail to the top in the <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/castle-rock-climb">Castle Rock Climb</a> post.<br><br>
	Since the trail to the top was closed, we admired Castle Rock from below and soaked in the Antarctic scenery. It's about here where you really feel like you're on a different planet, as you are well outside of town and can see parts of southwestern Ross Island, which isn't something people working in town see on the regular.<br><br>
	<center>

	</center>
	It was just before this shot here on our hike where we noticed the flags had stopped moving almost entirely, and recognized that without wind and being so far away from town it was dead silent. My hiking partner and I stopped and laid down on the trail to soak in the otherworldly silence and got up only because their feet were getting too cold to bear (completely understandable). They're a dear friend and we both agree that soaking in that quiet space remains a top 3 (if not number 1) Antarctic memory.<br><br>

	<font size="2">Just after the wind started to pick back up.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	Continuing on, you follow the curve of the trail eastward and down a large slope towards the ice shelf road. It's on this slope where you have to be careful, and sliding down is more advisable than straight walking.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/udvsmWZ.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9NhuabA.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<font size=2">Black flags mark a hazard, immediately to the left and right of the trail.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	After you make it to the ice shelf road, you come across the last shelter, which we dubbed the "alien". It's a Scott Base green dome with a commode inside.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5OT4Rho.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	From there, you're still about three or four miles away from McMurdo, and it's mostly uphill now! You hike on the ice shelf road back onto Ross Island, past Scott Base, and back into town past the fuel tanks (views I evidently don't have photographs of).<br><br>

<h2>Flag Breakdown</h2>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xdqBnHl.jpeg" width=99%><br><br>
	This is a very brief post on the flagging system for McMurdo station.<br><br>
	</center>
	The flagging system for McMurdo is very straightforward and almost entirely pertains to navigation on the ice shelf. Flags are mostly used to mark the roads but were also used to mark airstrip and airfield ramp boundaries as well as building locations.<br><br>
	<center>
	In short:<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DSTpVfv.jpeg" width=50%><br>
	<font style="color:green"><b>Green</font></b> means good, no apparent hazard.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KIzbQwa.jpeg" width=50%><br>
	<font style="color:red"><b>Red</b></font> means caution, be wary. This could be soft ice or unpacked snow.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fzt1Dge.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<b>Black</b> means caution, no travel. Immediate hazard such as a crevasse.<br><br></center>
	There is an additional flag colour, <font style="color:blue"><b>Blue</b></font>, which I don't have photographed. Blue flags mark the fuel lines that run from Ross island out to Williams and Phoenix airfields. These flags are less accessible for photographs as they follow more direct routes out to their destinations rather than following the roads.<br><br>
	<center>
	Crossed flags could be in any colour and are meant to attract greater attention.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8wiTO8C.jpeg" width=26.8%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BReB6K5.jpeg" width=63%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SvbfMAp.jpeg" width=20.5%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8qU8UlG.png" width=69.5%><br><br>
	</center>
	They are meant to signal a point of interest and to emphasize the original flag colour's meaning. The photos above give a few examples. Crossed black means "extreme danger, crevasse" as well as "park no further, drop". Crossed red could signifiy the end of a trail, or be paired with crossed green flags to signal an electrical cable.<br><br>
	These are just a few examples, as flags are pretty much everywhere on the ice shelf and around town to mark different things. You'll note that each one has a pole made of bamboo. This is due to the flexibility and low cost of the material. Flags face the harshest conditions the continent has to offer, year-round. Strong winds regularly break or topple flags and ease of replacement is important.<br><br>

<h2>Mail Call!</h2>
	<h4>2024.11.20</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hSpb91u.jpeg" width=70%><br><br>
	</center>
	The mail at McMurdo has a very good writeup by brr.fyi – I suggest you <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/mcmurdo-postal-mail">go look at that post</a> for a more detailed breakdown as I'll be going over the most basic and most pertinent details of sending and receiving mail while on the ice. For the most accurate and detailed information on ice mail, refer to the most recent version of the <a href="https://www.usap.gov/travelanddeployment/541/">USAP Participant Guide.</a><br><br>
	The post office is located in Building 140, which also houses shuttles and passenger services/logistics (the people who get you on the plane home). The addresses for McMurdo, Palmer, and Amundsen-Scott stations are all publically available and are located in the USAP Participant Guide. Each post office is handled by the armed forces and as such are listed as <a href="https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm">Army Post Offices (APO)</a>, meaning rates for sending mail to and from these offices are the same as domestic rates. That's correct, you can send a large flat-rate box to Antarctica for the same price as sending it within the United States.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k17d7o7.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	The mail is subject to the same mailing restrictions as regular international packages through the United States Postal Service, as each package is processed through New Zealand. Not only do you need to fill out <a href="https://about.usps.com/forms/ps2976r.pdf">Customs Form 2976-R</a> for the contents of your package, you need to make sure you're not mailing any prohibited items (I referenced the USPS <a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/imm/welcome.htm">International Mail Manual</a> and their <a href=https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/welcome.htm">Publication 52</a> which handles perishables and HAZMAT).<br><br>
	One of the first things I did in the weeks leading up to my deployment to the ice was put together a care package and send it to myself ahead of time. This way, I could save on some luggage weight by shipping things like soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, and snacks down through the mail. Liquids (hot sauces and shampoos) had to be triple-wrapped to prevent breakage as there is no guarantee of climate control for parcels.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OoYoSOp.jpeg" width=80%><br><br>
	</center>
	When mailing flat mail, you simply write the listed address, attach the necessary postage, and mail it as normal. When mailing any packages (and this includes envelopes with anything more than regular correspondance), you must fill out and attach <a href="https://about.usps.com/forms/ps2976r.pdf">Customs Form 2976-R</a> to the parcel. This can be done through services such as <a href="https://cns.usps.com/">USPS Click-N-Ship</a> or <a href="https://www.pirateship.com/">PirateShip</a>, and must be adhered to the package when handing it in to a U.S. Postal Worker. <u>You must go to a post office and hand it in to a postal worker to mail packages to an APO</u>.<br><br>
	When doing so, ensure they copy the address as listed. The postal worker I went to put in <a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28c2_010.htm">APO-AE</a> (Army Post Office - American East) by force of habit since most of APO mail they sent went to Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa – all of which fall under APO-AE. McMurdo and South Pole station are under the realm of APO-AP (Army Post Office - American Pacific).<br><br>
	When the package is out of your hands, it's in the care of the USPS via an <a href="https://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/cs09/CSPO_09_046.htm">International Service Center</a> (I was told McMurdo and Pole mail routes through Chicago) and eventually the United States Air Force (USAF) or New York Air National Guard (NYANG). It is likely that any package you receive will have been opened and inspected by New Zealand Customs (note the tape in the photo below). I was told that there is a customs training facility in Cheech and they like to use incoming Antarctic mail for practice.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vbywyZz.jpeg" width=60%><br><br>
	</center>
	En route to its destination in Antarctica, the mail follows a regular flight path from the USA to New Zealand. When in Christchurch, it is processed and held by an APO located right next to the <a href="https://macflora.net/October23.html#Oct231">Clothing Distribution Center (CDC)</a>. From there, tracking becomes unreliable and your package is at the mercy of the flight schedule and how much mail is waiting ahead of yours.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xCvdZXC.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<font size="2">There were at least two instances in 2023-2024 where people wrote to the station as a whole. Thanks Patrick.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	I briefly mentioned the "flight gap" in my post on <a href="https://macflora.net/October23.html#Oct236">Observation Hill</a>. This is the period from late November/early December to mid-to-late February where Phoenix airfield is too soft to handle regular flights and the C17s stop coming down. The C17s are very large planes, and regular flights means packages and freshies galore! However, when they halt operations, the LC-130Hs step up to the plate and handle intercontinental flights to and from Cheech. These planes are much smaller and can only hold so much, so only limited amounts of package mail will make it through on these flights (flat mail is generally able to be squeeezed on most flights).<br><br>
	Pair this fact with the hierarchy of cargo. On any given flight, certain cargos are deemed more important than others. If an essential item is needed on the next flight down, other items (including mail) will get pushed back. From what I recall, the general hierarchy for cargo (not including personnel) goes:<br><br>
	<center>
	Essential Items/Special Cargo > Regular Cargo and Instrumentation > Package Mail (sorted by size)<br><br>
	</center>
	That's right, if you have an egregiously large package, it will be bumped down the list. Freshies fall under "Special Cargo" given their limited shelf life – there were unfortunately times where weather kept planes on the tarmac in Cheech and our much-anticipated freshies sat for an extra few days.<br><br>
	When your package eventually makes it on a plane and down to the ice, it gets unloaded and sorted at Building 140, where they'll let you know if you've received mail. You can check if you have any waiting parcels by looking on the McMurdo Intranet (seeing your name on that long list of people always brought a wave of excitement). I chose this date for my post on mail because, well over two after mailing it to myself, my self-addressed package arrived!<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LNdgZpN.jpeg" width=60%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lk02Q1M.jpeg" width=30%><br><br>
	</center>
	Outgoing mail was regular enough during mainbody, but there were often signs posted on community boards detailing mailing deadlines. For things such as holidays or in instances where there would be slight flight gaps (such as between the end of mainbody and shoulder), the post office urged you to get an early jump on outgoing mail.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DUfvBOA.jpeg" width=34%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TuWxGlq.jpg" width=56%><br>
	<font size="2">Postal rates on a blue mailbox as well as a weigh station outside of the mailroom for outgoing parcels.</font><br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/s4zjmAi.jpeg" width=44.2%><br><br>
	</center>
	One last fun thing about the post office was their rubber stamp collection. I always made sure to decorate any postcards or envelopes with some of the art found there.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L7Z9Jsj.jpeg" width=41.9%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pRwOpgg.jpeg" width=48.1%><br><br>
	And all outgoing flatmail received the McMurdo Post Office Stamp as well!<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QGJj8PE.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>	
	To end this wall of text, I'll just say that receiving mail on station is a <i>huge</i> morale boost, and to walk out of Building 140 holding a postcard, letter, or package always put a big smile on my face. I hope I was able to make you as excited about the postal service as I am. Thank you for reading!<br><br>

<h2>South Pole Overland Traverse - SPOT</h2>
	<h4>2024.11.23</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FIP6ypR.png" width=90%><br>
	<font size="2">From reddit user The_Borpus.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	Let me be <b>EXTREMELY</b> clear up front: I had very limited interaction with the SPOT crew and cannot speak for the ins and outs of the mission. This post is a brief detail on what I know before pointing you in the proper directions to learn more about this extremely cool project.<br><br>
	SPOT, the South Pole Overland Traverse, is a project that aims to reduce the footprint for delivering cargo and fuel from McMurdo station to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Tractors pull fuel in huge bladders and cargo on sleds, along with a few buildings for living, sleeping, and storage, nearly 1,000 miles across the Ross Ice Shelf and the Leverett Glacier.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZkifcH9.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<font size="2">View from Willy field: SPOT tractors on the horizon, staged with fuel bladders in tow.</font><br><br>
	</center>
	The route is flagged and has been reused since the start of its constrution in 2002-2003, but road conditions vary from powdery snow to slush to hardened sastrugi, compacted snow drifts formed by wind. The main concern are crevasses, which form at the meeting points of the ice shelf and glacier, so tractors must take great care on the route. I've been told by a SPOT driver that the bumps felt when going over sastrugi jostle you around so much that your temper shortens and you get "tractor angry". Think hands tightly clutched and your body hunched over the steering wheel with an evil eye.<br><br>
	Altogether the bladders on one tractor can carry over 20,000 lbs of fuel and save approximately 30 to 40 flights to the South Pole each summer – historically, the LC-130H planes would fly down to the South Pole with more than enough fuel for their return trip to McMurdo station and simply offload the extra fuel. However, poor weather in the summertime can delay and drastically reduce the number of flights that make it to the Pole, raising concern for meeting necessary fuel stores before winter.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UEQ42jE.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ixDsSYn.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	SPOT is seen as a more reliable and less carbon-intensive way to get fuel and some cargo down to the Pole, with the added bonus of being able to take some waste and cargo back up to McMurdo on the return journey. As you can imagine, 20,000 lbs of fuel per tractor is quite heavy, and the journey south averages 5 MPH and takes, on average, over a month to complete (the fastest I've ever heard it done was three weeks). The return journey, unburdened by all of the fuel, averages over 10 MPH and takes only a few weeks. On the internal mailing list, we would often get updates on where the SPOT team was and what they were seeing.<br><br>
	That's about all I know about SPOT – below are some links to other looks, videos, and firsthand accounts of people on the SPOT team. Props to them - they were treated like superstars on station from what I saw and they deserved it. With such a remote environment and limited team, everyone has to be multi-talented in order to fill several jobs at once; mechanic, meteorologist, cook, driver, and more.<br><br>
