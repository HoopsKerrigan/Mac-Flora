<h3>Weather and Piecemeal Plants</h3>
	<h4>2023.06.02 - 2023.06.07</h4>
	</center>
	Just a quick update spanning a few days with no main goal in particular but just some neat things to share.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/meelrkY.png" width=90%><br>	
	</center>
	Something cool about having such a clear view of such great distances is the ability to observe rain showers from far away. Above is a panorama of an overcast day when thunder and lightning passed within a mile or two north of the tower. In North Carolina, you're boxed in enough to only really see a thunderstorm when it's coming right down on you. Out here, even while on the ground without a lot of prominence, you can see them for quite a ways.<br><br>
	<center>

	</center>
	Another thing that I hadn't seen before coming out west was virga, a phenomenon in which rain evaporates before it hits the ground, giving the appearance of veils of rain hanging below clouds. In the above photos, you can see that a decent amount of rain still hits the ground (on account of the relatively high humidity we've had) but there are streaks that don't quite make it.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/K7yDxE1.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/0oDttTg.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	While we're on weather, I was caught in a quick hailstorm that evening while headed back to the station. Over and done in about 10 minutes, it left the ground looking like snow had fallen.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/mCFX8nA.png" width=28%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/FFN2UZW.png" width=62%><br>	
	</center>
	Mojave pricklypoppy (<i>Argemone corymbosa</i>, Papaveraceae) started coming into bloom today and it shows up alongside the road on my commute.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/EEN7qHk.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/mjS90Ju.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	A splash of colour that has come into bloom over the past week or so comes from purple sage (<i>Salvia dorrii</i>, Lamiaceae), which starts to show up as you get higher up the mountain towards the lookout.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ETV8G5N.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	Our old friend desert evening-primose (<i>Oenothera caespitosa</i>, Onagraceae) persists and has started to fully line the road.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/ufouRHq.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/P3M0uHA.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	Here's a bright bloom with a fun name, Arizona firecracker (<i>Ipomopsis arizonica</i>, Polemoniacead). It has started to pop up here and there in some of the lower areas of the drive to Ella Mountain, often a bit aways from the side of the road.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/cCL2TpY.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	The Arizona firecrackers hang out in the same spot near the ponderosas as these firecracker penstemon (<i>Penstemon eatonii</i>, Plantaginaceae).<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/5kS8YpG.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	The prickly pear cacti (<i>Opuntia</i> spp.) are also coming out in full force, I've seen yellows, magentas, and reds along the road up to the tower.<br><br>
	Here's a small creature feature on some of the moving things I've seen over the past week.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/EjC3qe4.png" width=28%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/uxoiG3a.png" width=62%><br>
	</center>
	This isn't the first rattlesnake I've seen but it is the first I had a chance to photograph.<br><br>
	I <i>believe</i> it's a Mojave green rattlesnake (<i>Crotalus scutulatus</i> for the herp people), but had trouble given the fact that my photographs didn't get clearer photos of the tail, head, or colouration. That, paired with the fact that there are <i>six</i> different rattlesnake species in Nevada, five of which hang around the southern corner of the state around where Caliente is, gave me some trouble as I'm used to keying things that don't move (or bite).<br><br>
	Hopefully these photos suffice since I didn't want to get out of the truck for a closer shot.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/Co3nKKx.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/F9h9UCx.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	Once again in the Barnes Canyon burn scar I saw wild horses. I have been able to spot them pretty reliably when I take that route, sometimes up to a half dozen at a time.<br><br>
	Taking a look at these burn scars, it's interesting to note how these areas look similar to the ghost forests on the U.S. Atlantic Coast, yet these are almost a welcome sight as they are a sign of reintroduction of fire to an area (if unintentional) and the proliferation of wildflowers, sagebrush, and other scrub species on a site that was once strictly piñon-juniper.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/0HEGp2i.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	Last up on the creature feature is... a gorilla! I'll be honest that this fella gave me a spook the first time I noticed him.<br><br>

<h3>Smokey Bear – I Work With a Celebrity</h3>
	<h4>2023.06.08</h4>
	</center>
	We were in Ely for the district-wide orientation this week (two days of death by powerpoint), and while in the district office I noticed a wall of old Smokey Bear art.<br><br>

	<center><img src="https://imgur.com/4n6Y1oc.png" width=90%><br><br></center>
	Below are all of the frames I could photograph (phone quality, sorry). Most people I've talked to agree that Smokey art is decent at best and creepy at worst. I suggest you look at each of the following pictures individually in a new tab to get a feel for some typical Smokey posters.<br><br>

	Talking to people in Forestry and Fire, you get the understanding that quite a bit of harm was done with his initial messaging back in the day, particularly in terms of fire's place in the landscape (partly backtracked in the wording of his messaging). To quote one friend: "He <i>killed</i> America's Forests!".<br><br>
	What I mean by harmful messaging is the general dislike of fire that arose that has ties to Smokey Bear messaging – fire has a place and a history on virtually every landscape and every ecosystem on the planet. Whether it's an area that burns annually or near-annually or one that is touched by fire once every 10,000 years, fire is a common form of disturbance that has both non-anthropogenic and anthropogenic histories around the world.<br><br>
	Many will agree that Smokey Bear has been the most effective piece of American propaganda ever, and I don't think that's too far off the mark for the longest-running public service announcement in U.S. history. The official Smokey Bear website has the <a href="https://smokeybear.com/en/smokeys-history/about-the-campaign">history of the campaign</a>, but the short of it was that during WWII, the U.S. Forest Service was looking to increase public awareness of fire to prevent wildfires before they happened due to the fact that the regular cohort of foresters and firefighters were overseas fighting in the war. Wildfires at home would pull resources away from the war so stopping them before they even happened was a top priority, and after the use of the newly-released <i>Bambi</i> was a success, the U.S. Forest Service brought Smokey Bear into the picture on August 9, 1944.<br><br>
	Since then, his message has been spread far and wide (<a href="https://smokeybear.com/en/smokeys-history/story-of-smokey">including actual bear cubs</a>) which has resulted in one of the most recognizable American icons, next to Uncle Sam and the Statue of Liberty. You may notice that in all of the above paintings, his message is the same "Prevent <b>Forest</b> Fires" (an important distinction from <b>wild</b>fires). Smokey's message led to a negative perception of fire in any form on the landscape, and people unaware of fire's necessary role as a disturbance tend to view it as something to be prevented. More recently, Smokey's messaging has switched to "Prevent Wildfires", but people I've talked to agree that the damage has been done. To many, the separation of unintended fires and prescribed burns is weak, and fire is fire.<br><br>
	That is not to say that the current rising trend of high-intensity scorched earth fires is what current or historic plant communities need (thanks climate change), but a reduction of fuels is important for helping undo over a century of damage caused by suppression of fire and fuels buildup, a suite of practices that changed as a result of the 1988 Yellowstone fires (among other things). So yes, there many of us who can see the damage that fire suppression has done and the Sisyphean task that is reintroducing less-intense and more frequent fire to landscapes that are essentially covered in gasoline that are within an increasingly blurred wildland-urban interface. We see this challenge and how Smokey Bear has helped create this can of worms, but we also can't help but gravitate towards him as an icon.<br><br>
	As I wrote, there has been a change in his messaging and an understanding that fire is part of the landscape, but it should be done so intentionally by professionals (hence the continued messaging against unintentional and careless burns). Still, I really like the hokey-ness of Smokey as a character and didn't realize how much Smokey memorabilia I actually had until now. Among friends and colleagues (many of whom share the sentiments I wrote above), I've seen shirts, patches, mugs, pins, posters, magnets, license plates, you name it. It's hard to hate Smokey, it seems, and I hold little grudge against him personally for past transgressions. Below are some of the paraphenalia I've seen and photographed.<br><br>

	</center>
	If you don't believe me about how people in ecology gravitate towards Smokey, I had to bid $50 at an auction on the framed poster in the third image (Grand Old Forest) against several other people to win it.<br><br>
	Moving on from some of the Smokey merch, I'll get into Smokey as an image today. Smokey Bear is still an active campaign by the U.S. Forest Service and his image is protected by U.S. Federal Law to deter misuse of him and to prevent damage or dilution of his image. Our office has a Smokey Bear costume that comes out occasionally (Memorial Day, Fourth of July, local sporting events), and it's only a matter of time before I don the Smokey costume. When he's not in use, he is kept locked (yes, locked) in a blue bin in the office of the person responsible for the Smokey costume here in the station.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/zD8LlJ9.png" width=45%><br><br>
	</center>
	When it's time for Smokey to come out, he's laid out for an hour or more to air out, then he's donned by that day's wearer before being properly fit and groomed, all before he even steps outside for a public appearance. The costume includes the head with hat, the full suit itself, padding, an ice pack vest, gloves, and feet. It was an interesting morning coming out to find Smokey in pieces on the dining table.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/zqYsc8v.png" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Funnily enough, this isn't the first Smokey costume I've seen, though he appears to be a newer version of one I've met not once but twice at the U.S. Forest Service Mountain Training Facility in Crossnore, North Carolina.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/6hBT2Ut.png" width=50%><br><br>
	</center>
	But when they're all dressed up and groomed, Smokey is ready to make an appearance. There are lots of rules that Smokey must follow when making a public appearance (outlined <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/finalsmokeyhandoutsacessibleforweb.pdf">here</a>), which causes the station's Smokey costume manager to sweat bullets any time Smokey is out of the box. You can see the nervousness on his face as he makes sure everything is up to snuff and there are no mishaps with the furry friend. Smokey has to be accompanied by a handler/wrangler, both to talk for Smokey and to make sure he doesn't fall over as visibility and movement are limited in the suit.<br><br>
	At public events, we hand out Smokey Bear goodie bags to anyone who wants them as a way to spread awareness, and Smokey usually gives lots of high fives, hugs, and photo opporunities. I managed to nab a bag this past week to show the contents.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/iGLuQSv.png" width=60%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/BZEU3py.png" width=30%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/tPkzP5t.png" width=90%><br><br>
	Here's a closeup of the pin, which immediately went on my hat.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/67O1dvL.png" width=30%><br><br>
	</center>
	So that's a semi-brief rundown on Smokey and my opinion on him, which is shared by many others in ecology. He can be a little divisive within this group but many agree that the hokeyness of him is great despite issues with his past messaging and the public's perception of fire as a direct or indirect result of that. Either way, I'll keep being a Smokey Bear fan (and keep wearing a campaign hat for botanizing – I started doing so because of the bear).<br><br>

<h3>The Osborne Fire Finder</h3>
	<h4>2023.06.11</h4>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/hDq0XVm.png" width=50%><br><br>
	</center>
	This morning I spotted my first two smoke columns within half an hour of each other which led to a busy morning in the district when compared to what we've been seeing. Unfortunately the two fires were small enough that our engine crew back at the station still had to go to their review (something they have been prepping for and wanting to be over for a few weeks now). I figured now is as good a time as ever to give a rundown on the Osborne Fire Finder.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/AWOmEwr.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	The Osborne Fire Finder is the centerpiece of most any staffed fire lookout tower and serves as a way to locate a fire with a high degree of accuracy. Invented by William Osborne and first put into service in 1915, the fire finder essentially acts as a compass to give direction and estimated distance relative to the fire tower.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/VdC2IBu.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	In the above photo you can see that the fire finder is made up of a circular disk with a topographical map of the area centered around the lookout tower. The radius of the disk is roughly equivalent to the operational range of the tower so if you can see it, it <i>should</i> be able to be located on the map. If not, there are a number of topographical maps of the surrounding area I can use for further aid.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/lX7MbCz.png" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/0lv5NrP.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	These topo maps have a scale of 1:100,000 and are an excellent resource for really looking at the landscape. The above photo of the spread is from when I was making that cheat sheet for peak names around the tower.<br><br>
	So how does one call in a fire with the Osborne Fire Finder?<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/0c33lHq.png" width=62%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/wxu0FUs.png" width=28%><br>
	</center>
	You should have noticed these two vertical sighting apertures on either side of the disk. One is a brass plate with angles of elevation change and a slit in the center, and the other is largely empty with a set of crosshairs strung inside. They are aligned in such a way that when looking through the slit on the brass plate, you can see and line up your sight with the crosshairs, with a sliding tab that can account for change in elevation from the observer's point of view in the tower.<br><br>
	These apertures are mounted on a ring that sits outside the topographic map disk that spins freely, meaning if you spot a fire you can spin the Fire Finder until you can view it directly through the sighting apertures. The spinning ring rests on a graduated ring and is marked with degrees, with 0° being a sightline directly North of the tower.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/RjoQx7K.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/DzzcCkn.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	When you have your sights lined up to your fire, the reading you get is your azimuth, and this is a very accurate measure of direction of the fire from the tower. If you happen to shoot an azimuth that lines up with a window frame, the door, etc., you can move the entire apparatus to try and get a better view. The stand on which it rests has two sets of rails that can be used to slide the Fire Finder back and forth if you need to make an adjustment, and it has negligible effect on the final reading.<br><br>
	You may recall that this is the sole staffed lookout tower in the state of Nevada, and that may make you wonder how distance and location can be accurately determined without a second azimuth to intersect the first and pinpoint the location of the reading. It's true that in the past, or in areas where multiple towers have overlapping operational ranges, intersection is used – triangulation isn't necessary because unlike cellular towers that use time as a way to gauge distance, when you shoot an azimuth you already have a direction and only need one intersecting reading.<br><br>
	As such, distance is a bit more relative when using one tower and that's where knowledge of the surrounding landscape and the ability to parse topographical maps comes in handy. We can use the smoke columns I spotted this morning as an example.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/tzl0m8C.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/s2TbL0G.png" width=46%><br>
	Can you spot the two fires in these photos? I promise they're there, each photo has one smoke column.<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/mVdZvLe.png" width=45%>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/5r7EiFC.png" width=46%><br>
	I'm sure now you can see where the fun of this job comes from...<br><br>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/xnXuotP.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	So the first thing to do is line the smoke up in our sights and get our azimuth. When we have that, we can start to estimate distance. First, you look at surrounding geographic features that are known to see what neighbourhood the smoke is in. In this case (the above images on the left) it was southeast of Grey Dome (a.k.a. Sugarloaf, seen in the top left of the photo), which we know is 17 miles away from the tower. From there, we have an idea of the neighbourhood in which to look on the topo map (again, this is where ability to read them comes in handy).<br><br>
	After looking on the topo map on the Fire Finder, we deduce it's south of U.S. 93 using local landmarks and the general shape of the land. Below you can see Grey Dome in the top left of the image, the lookout in the bottom right (blue circle), and U.S. 93 highlighted in yellow. We know it's somewhere south of the highway on an azimuth that shoots from the tower to just east of Grey Dome (white line).<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/jEDSfsc.png" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	While this is already a pretty good estimate, we can get more specific using township, range, and section. <a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/course/ffm/location/611-base-township-range-sections-corners">Here</a> is the National Wildfire Coordinating Group's page on townships, ranges, and sections, but the short version is that it's a grid system on which to pinpoint a fire.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/boI5TdX.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	You can see in the above image that along the grids on the map are labels such as "T9S", "T10S", "R70E", "R69E". These are your <b><u>T</b></u>ownships (changing with latitude) and your <b><u>R</b></u>anges. Each overlapping square of any given township and range is 36 square miles.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/UNYAZAy.png" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	To get more specific within that 36 square mile area, you use this little plastic square to determine what section the fire is in. The section snakes from the top right to the bottom right, and each square on this plastic card is one square mile. From there, you can give further division by "corners" – you have your four corners (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast), and your corners of the corners (northeast corner of the southwest corner) for a final division of 1/16th of a square mile.<br><br>
	This level of division can be helpful but isn't always needed, as anyone coming up on the fire should be able to see it if you can get them down to the nearest square mile. Our district tends to send both an engine and a helicopter when they can and if I can see it, the helicopter can see it. Dispatch has the exact same map and grid as the tower and they will take the township, range, and section you provide to convert it into coordinates that resources can simply plug into a GPS for quick navigation.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://imgur.com/kTOyKcH.png" width=60%><br>
	</center>
	So using the info we just gathered on that first smoke report, we can fill out this smoke report sheet. While all of the information is necessary, the near-exact location can be obtained with just the township, range, and section. In the case of the fire we just shot, it's R66E, T4S, Section 19.
	When you have all of that information, you fill out this sheet and call it into dispatch, basically reading down the sheet as you go along. From there, the radio becomes a beehive as dispatch calls different resources to go and get on whatever it is that you've called in.<br><br>
	With all of that information, happy hunting!<br><br>
