<h2>CLT to CHC - Traveling to Christchurch</h2>
	<h4>2023.10.08 – 2023.10.11</h4>
	</center>
	This all starts from my airport of departure (AOD), Charlotte NC. One of the packets I filled out during the mountain of paperwork was a travel document, and that included information regarding where my initial departure would be from. It's based off of the physical mailing address I was using when going back and forth with the USAP.<br><br>
	A few weeks before my flight date, I was emailed an itinerary which detailed all of my stops (it was actually mailed the day before my supposed flight date but due to a kerfuffle I was bumped back two weeks). I was to fly from Charlotte (KCLT) to Chicago (KORD) to San Francisco (KSFO), then leave the U.S. and go to Auckland (AKL) and then Christchurch (CHC). In total, it was 24ish hours of flight time and almost exactly 36 hours from Charlotte to Cheech.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QLBvW3O.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hneBnrZ.jpg" width=45%><br>
	My last sunset in the U.S. for another six months!<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vnaF7si.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RujXVds.jpeg" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JMCclJY.jpg" width=90%><br><br></center>
	The longest flight was from San Francisco to Auckland, a nonstop flight totalling 14ish hours overnight. I lost the entirety of October 12th crossing the international date line, but knew I'd make that day back coming back to the states. This flight was also my first in-flight meal! It didn't disappoint.<br><br>

	36 hours later - Cheech! After a quick check in with some USAP folks, I was at my hotel and that was it! I had some meetings and check ins each morning, as well as a time to pickup all of my cold weather gear, but that was it and I was all of a sudden alone in a new city, some 8500 miles as the crow flies away from NC. Crazy.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ljHXgcD.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jydcb8D.jpeg" width=45%><br><br>
	</center>
	I spent a total of five days in Christchurch – three were planned but there were two days of delays, as we were waiting for a group to fly ahead of us. Each day was spent poking around the area and eating good food – the Riverside Market was a favourite haunt of mine and there were days where I ate every meal there. I missed it and thought of it regularly while on the ice and miss it now that I'm back in Nevada.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2JE4Y4H.jpg" width=60%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UxyicrU.jpeg" width=30%><br><br></center>
	I didn't photograph everything but all of the food was good. Little did I know at this point how much I would miss it! I have a very fond memory of several USAP folks and I headed to a bakery early in the morning and devouring fresh bread.<br><br>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cyRxXht.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	I also made sure to introduce some USAP folks to the wonders of a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Do-the-Tim-Tam-Slam">Tim Tam Slam</a>.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cpkpVpn.jpg" width=70%></center><br><br>
	Another Kiwi staple I came to love (especially while on the ice) was Whittaker chocolate. Even now, stateside, I'm tempted to pay the horrible shipping costs to mail one to me.<br><br>
	But I'm getting ahead of myself, and this isn't a <a href="https://foodmeistermac.net">food blog</a> (I promise)! The first thing I did after checking into my hotel was walking a few short minutes to the botanical gardens and greenspace just a bit west of Cheech's downtown. I wanted to see what flora they had growing locally!<br><br>

	</center>We start with London plane tree (<i>Platanus</i> X <i>acerifolia</i>, Platanaceae), which were among the largest and most common ornamentals found in the park.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pMZIIC3.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1AfFlxF.jpg" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2sENFfD.jpg" width=90%><br></center>
	Some kind of ornamental pine (<i>Pinus</i> sp., Pinaceae), likely old world. I couldn't narrow it down but this was more of a quick walk to stretch my legs rather than an ID walk.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6O1RFiK.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xU0uqXg.jpg" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DtzNFjX.jpg" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	Here was a familiar one: dawn redwood (<i>Metasequoia glyptostroboides</i>, Cupressaceae)! This was among the first I knew and it was so funny to see down here.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Foxcwdl.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dsenFIS.jpeg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fLxAwRf.jpeg" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	This one made me laugh: boxelder (<i>Acer negundo</i>, Sapindaceae)! A weed in some parts of NC, planted for show 8500 miles away in Cheech. Hello, old friend.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LzOuVAY.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OFdsW6w.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	A classic deodar cedar (<i>Cedrus deodara</i>, Pinaceae)! Not native to NC but planted commonly enough in people's yards. I guess taste is ubiquitous.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/A4IdxBR.jpeg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cnvAgeq.jpeg" width=45%><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TPnKFRd.jpeg" width=90%><br></center>
	Some kind of gum tree (<i>Eucalyptus</i> sp., Myrtaceae)? I didn't stop for too long but I appreciated its form and it's novelty to my southeastern flora brain.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5fX29ny.jpeg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qI4YZnJ.jpeg" width=45%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WoMZviP.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	</center>
	But novelty isn't as fun as seeing sweetgum (<i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i>, Altingiaceae) in a planted setting! Depending on who you ask, it's as weedy as a plant can get in NC! You can hardly throw a rock and miss it, and here people were planting the fruitless cultivar intentionally! I guess it's nice to have some familiarity when you're all the way across the globe.<br><br>
	There were other plants from across the globe that I immediately suspected to be old world in origin, such as:<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pVTQsXI.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ASNmmOH.jpg" width=45%><br>
	Alder (<i>Alnus</i> sp., Betulaceae).<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TEJjF9m.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oTYeyAO.jpg" width=45%><br>
	English oak (<i>Quercus robur</i>, Fagaceae).<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pVSbGP5.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LvncGbX.jpg" width=45%><br>
	Elm (<i>Ulmus</i> sp., Ulmaceae), and more.<br><br></center>
	But I don't think it's fun to go to New Zealand for the first time and discuss plants native to Europe. With a few more days in and around Cheech, I spent some time looking at some of the flora one could find on this island nation. More to come on that note.<br><br>
	I did take some photographs of the local fauna, but I am not a birder so to me these are all birds (with the exception of the eels, of course). If you have an inkling of specific ID for these folks, let me know!<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GTr3ygS.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	In all, Cheech is a wonderful city and the Riverside Market is dangerous for those on a diet.<br><br>

<h2>Fit Check – Cold Weather Gear Issue at the International Antarctic Center</h2>
	<h4>2023.10.12</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/h1srkyy.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	The first morning in Christchurch included a couple of hours at the Clothing Distribution Center (CDC), which is a part of the International Antarctic Center, right across from Christchuch International Aiport (IATA code CHC - Cheech!). This center is a well-oiled machine that has done this too many times to keep count of.<br><br>
	The bulk of the time was spent receiving all issued gear (our Extreme Cold Weather gear - ECW), trying it on, swapping out things that didn't fit properly, and then packing it all up when we were happy with what we had. They say that there's no such thing as poor weather, just poor clothing, so it was important to make sure everything fit and was functional. Some of these clothing items are decades old, so it's vital to check that velcro, zippers, pockets, etc. are all functional, and to make sure there are no holes or mobility issues. It's easier to swap things out there in Cheech than it would be while down onthe ice.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YhAaImF.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	This wall details all of the ECW you receive when headed to the ice.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iUmxuXu.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	Here's the changing room where you receive and try on all of your ECW.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8KjW6ij.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	After confirming with checkout all of the ECW you're going to take down to the ice, you pack it back in the bright orange bags and put your travel tags on them. All ECW bags are stacked up in the hallway of the CDC, ready to be taken down south.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oCYQOME.jpg" width=60%><br><br>
	Here is my issued big red. I came to find it quite quickly on coatracks as it was always the most faded one.<br><br>
	</center>
	As a first year worker, you're required to take all issued ECW with you to the ice. In subsequent years, you are allowed a little more freedom to pick and choose, though you must take all items that must be worn on flights (shown below) or have your own equivalent piece of clothing.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xs8Puu9.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	After the gear checkout, we had a COVID-19 test and a brief orientation, and that was it for the day aside from an afternoon Zoom check-in. That left us free to roam Cheech in our off time. As you move around Cheech, you find things here and there that have to do with Antarctica. It was kind of funny to see these plaques and statues knowing that I was headed there soon.<br><br>

	<i>"CHRISTCHURCH AND ANTARCTICA<br>
	Christchurch is one of the main gateways to Antarctica.	From the early 1900s, British expeditions used the Port of Lyttelton on their way to Antarctica. In 1955, Christchurch became the base for the United States Antarctic Programme known as Operation Deep Freeze. Today Christchurch continues to be used as a base for the Antarctic Programme of several nations."<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/amigoC6.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	And of course it wouldn't be a post without a postcard shot. I picked up a few to send north through the New Zealand post.<br><br>

<h2>The Christchuch Botanic Gardens</h2>
	<h4>2023.10.13</h4>
	</center>
	The Christchurch Botanic Gardens were just a short walk away from my hotel and I was able to visit them each day I was in town. It was just coming into spring when I was in Cheech, so lots of things were already blooming as the southern hemisphere was warming up.<br><br>
	This was a good place to see a fun mix of northern (both old and new world) and southern hemisphere plants. And luckily, most of the plants I had no knowledge on were labeled!<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tqMA4wF.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3XtdnkO.jpg" width=90%><br>
	Brown Barrel (<i>Eucalyptus fastigata</i>, Myrtaceae).<br><br>

	Alpine ash (<i>Eucalyptus delegatensis</i>, Myrtaceae).<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gspBmtc.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LYXIbgZ.jpg" width=90%><br>
	Rewarewa (<i>Knightia excelsa</i>, Proteaceae [A new family for me!]).<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xIUrumU.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gon6pS6.jpg" width=90%><br>
	Karaka (<i>Corynocarpus laevigatus</i>, Corynocarpaceae).<br><br>
	</center>
	A bit of a tangent here - Corynocarpaceae was also a new family and while looking into the meaning behind the family name I found that the etymology is a little foggy. The best lead I found was that <i>coryno-</i> is likely derived from the Greek word <i>korynē</i>, which meant "club" or "mace", according to the <a href="https://www.etymonline.com">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://cdn.auckland.ac.nz/assets/nzplants/Seed%20Plants%20Flowering/C/Corynocarpus%20Corynocarpaceae/09%20coryno_fem12a(PS).jpg" width=47%>
	<img src="https://cdn.auckland.ac.nz/assets/nzplants/Seed%20Plants%20Flowering/C/Corynocarpus%20Corynocarpaceae/10%20coryno_male10a(PS).jpg" width=43%><br>
	<img src="https://cdn.auckland.ac.nz/assets/nzplants/Seed%20Plants%20Flowering/C/Corynocarpus%20Corynocarpaceae/11%20coryno_fem17a(PS).jpg" width=45%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NnLWG6H.jpeg" width=45%><br>
	L. Jensen, University of Auckland.<br><br>
	</center>
	While I couldn't find any explicit writing on this in my brief search, the name Corynocarpaceae, named for the type genus <i>Corynocarpus</i> suggests a club (coryno-) shaped carpel (carpus-), or "section" of the ovary. Whether this shape is described in the floral or fruiting stage is unclear, but here's a flower of Corynocarpus laevigatus from the University of Auckland. My hunch is outlined in yellow, as you can see a club-ish shape in the pistil.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OWVMFP2.jpg" width=90%><br>
	From across the pond, Wheki (<i>Dicksonia squarrosa</i>, Dicksoniaceae), a type of tree fern! So excited to see these, as my only interaction with them until this point was looking at fossil specimens.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Yb7eA0s.jpg" width=90%><br>
	And another: rough tree fern (<i>Cyathea australis</i>, Polypodiophyta), this one native to Australia.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PXSWWah.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AcTJnvb.jpg" width=90%><br>
	As I said, there was a mix of northern and southern hemisphere plants, including some North American familiars such as baldcypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>, Cupressaceae).<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YXg4cl9.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ohsyFCD.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5OILkRM.jpg" width=45%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dPAsUjL.jpg" width=45%><br>
	And giant sequoia (<i>Sequoiadendron giganteum</i>, Cupressaceae)!<br><br>
	</center>
	This was only a fraction of the plants on display at the botanic gardens. It was a wonderful spot to visit and I knew I would miss it dearly and think of it often when I jumped to the ice. I came here a few times during my time in Cheech, but still not as frequently as the Riverside market.<br><br>

<h2>Lyttelton Hike, Up and Down</h2>
	<h4>2023.10.13</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EeV9mur.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Everyone going through Cheech is scheduled three days there, for orientation, gear issue, and some touch-up meetings before heading to the ice. However, some gnarly weather at McMurdo had delayed flights for nearly 10 days by the time I arrived in New Zealand, and there was a group ahead of us still waiting to go. After the first three days, we were told to sit tight and look out for daily updates on whether or not we would fly the following day. On one of these delays, some folks and I went to Lyttelton, a small town just outside of Cheech.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/h5hD8ug.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	We took a bus to a cable car service that would take you up the mountain with the intention to hike down the other side into Lyttelton. Signs on the grassy bald warned you about high fire danger.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wU2zGsF.jpg" width=90%><br>
	From the top, you could see Lyttelton port, historic gateway to the Antarctic.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/s3MZO3r.jpg" width=45%><br>
	Here is a type of broom (<i>Cytisus</i> sp., Fabaceae) found at the top of the mountain, a display of austral spring in yellow.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RpcYkNi.jpg" width=90%><br>
	Some kind of stonecrop (<i>Sedum</i> spp., Crassulaceae), very small along the walk.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vTEUToI.jpg" width=90%><br>
	This bushy fellow, which dominated much of the southern top of the mountain, was either New Zealand flax (<i>Phormium tenax</i>, Asphodelaceae) or mountain flax (<i>Phormium colensoi</i>, Asphodelaceae).<br><br>Either way, the inflorescence is a ringer for Asperagales.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/agJCQHn.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DqXFnVn.jpg" width=90%><br>
	This appears to be cotton fireweed (<i>Senecio quadridentatus</i>, Asteraceae). While native to New Zealand, it is reported to be a weedy species that is toxic to livestock.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3elkwfk.jpeg" width=70%><br>
	The above photo of me looking at the cotton fireweed falls into a category of photos I have titled:<br> "<i>Mac hunched over a tiny little plant ignoring the scenic vista behind</i>".<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/B8Ziduq.jpg" width=90%><br>
	This one, with brilliant burgundy blossoms, is field sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosella</i>, Polygonaceae). It is not native to New Zealand and is considered weedy on disturbed sites particularly with acidic soils.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MYVYzy6.jpg" width=90%><br>
	The last plant for this post is English broom (<i>Cytisus scoparius</i>, Fabaceae), a plant native to western Europe that is a destructive invasive in other parts of the world, including New Zealand.<br><br>

	And that brings you to Lyttelton! A small town just a busride away from Cheech. We spent the afternoon taking in the wharf, seeing the town, and enjoying a fresh pizza that spewed out steam into the overcast day much like the one in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uugZuNnDCEg">Home Alone</a>.<br><br>

<h2>Ice Bound!</h2>
	<h4>2023.10.16</h4>
	Finally, I detail the flight from Cheech to McMurdo! Only eight months later...<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kpJkcFE.jpg" width=90%><br>
	First, we say goodbye to Scott and all things green on our last night in civilization.<br><br>
	</center>As I said, there are three days scheduled in Christchurch - one is for arrival, one is for gear issue and a touch-base meeting, and one is for your flight. As my group came into Christchurch, another group had already been there for over a week due to weather delays. As such, we knew that we wouldn't be flying until after they had left and didn't have to prep every morning for a potential flight.<br><br><center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3SGKWSZ.jpeg" width=46%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wPW2IWN.jpeg" width=45%><br><br>
	</center>We received updates like this under our hotel room doors, indicating what flight delays (if any) were anticipated. A notice of a 24-hour delay was typical, but you can see that on Friday's memo, we were delayed "until further notice". This is because of the aforementioned group ahead of us, and the uncertainty on whether that group would make an attempt to fly on Sunday (flights on Sunday are unusual for ice missions).<br><br><center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RlaQlej.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	On Sunday, we received the above notice, telling us where to be at what time for our attempted flight to the ice.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fCLVS3w.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hcxlxx1.jpeg" width=60%><br><br>
	An early start has us shuttled to the Clothing Distribution Center (CDC) once again, this time to ensure all of our baggage was under weight limits and ready to be palletized and loaded onto the plane. Baggage I'll save for another post.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qg2gJR2.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WxREwYx.jpeg" width=36%>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jRhh3cG.jpeg" width=55%><br><br>
	</center>We're then lined up to head through the Passenger Terminal. There, we had a brief video orientation on what to expect on the ice before lining up and checking our luggage. Much like at a regular airport, it's weighed and you put your carry-on items through an X-ray to be screened, only this was done by the U.S. Air Force. It was also at this time that you were checked to have all of the necessary Extreme Cold Weather (ECW) gear before boarding.<br><br>
	There were a few bouts of time where we were waiting on the crew to finish their checklists, and it was during one of these breaks where I walked to a nearby grocery store to grab my last food from New Zealand - a golden kiwi. I didn't know it at the time, but I thought of that kiwi <i>incredibly</i> often in times between freshies.<br><br>
	<center>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L81JlnA.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	And just like that, it's time to board! We took a shuttle to the tarmac, picked up our flight lunches (there is a vegetarian option), and then boarded the absolutely <i>massive</i> C17.<br><br>There were over 100 of us on the southbound flight, as well as some additional cargo.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VorwMoj.jpg" width=90%><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/a2OpO8p.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	It was a pretty uneventful flight all told. I was seated towards the rear of the plane, near one of the emergency exits. This meant I had a window seat all the way to the ice. Granted, the window was 6" across and 6 feet away.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1RPJhsj.jpg" width=60%><br><br>
	The flight is about five hours long on a C17, compared to around 8 on an LC-130. Some highlights from the flight do include a gift shop run out of a plastic storage container and asking nicely to climb up and see the cockpit.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xuOnQ9c.jpg" width=70%><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zXExWsd.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Approximately 30 minutes before landing, they announced for us to put on all of our ECW, and before we knew it we were on the ground! It was a few minutes before we got off of the plane, as the crew had to ensure everything was secure and the cargo team began taking the goods out of the rear of the plane.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6IaieIx.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	We walked off of the skiway towards shuttle vehicles, which would take us to McMurdo station. The large passenger vehicle I hopped on was the Kress, and it was ~1hr30 from Phoenix airfield to McMurdo.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/g3246Xk.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>Once on station, we sat through another orientation video, had time for some questions, then met our supervisors to discuss our first day of work the next day. After that, we received our room assignments, linen bags, and picked up our luggage, all just in time for dinner.<br><br>
	<center>

	My first McMurdo meal.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UtKY9b5.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	And that's it! I made it all the way to McMurdo, ready for work and excited for who knows what would come my way. I had a stack of postcards ready to rip and a new continent to experience.<br><br>

	Thanks for reading, if you've made it this far! I know I have been delayed in posting but being on the ice proved to be much, much, <i>much</i> busier than I ever anticipated. I do intend to catch up on many fun things from the ice, so stay tuned!<br><br>

<h2>Preface to Antarctica</h2>
	<h4>Written July 2024</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yptu2Ex.jpeg" width=90%><br><br></center>
	I've spent a long time thinking about how I'd like to write about the ice. I knew outright that I didn't want to write about the people there, the community, the social life – things that were my favourite part of Antarctica. There are a lot of cool people there, but it's not my story to share and it would feel "wrong" to do an exposé on life down on the ice. These people are my friends, and I'm not here to gab about them.<br><br>
	I also hope not to write too much about myself – I've noticed that I've slipped myself onto this site more often as of late, and while some topics (like traveling through New Zealand) are fun, it's not the purpose of this blog. Of course, I'm pretty far removed from plants while at the buck-end of the planet. While this isn't a personal blog, it's a blog written through my lens and my experience, so understand that when reading about the ice. I had a <i>very</i> different experience from someone working in the deep field, in management, in the science labs, etc.<br><br>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u01Ifhn.jpeg" width=90%><br><br></center>
	Instead, I knew I wanted to write about some of the interesting, less personal things down there – the food, the weather, some logistics, odd quirks, neat happenings – it's kind of all over the place. It's also not as easy to tell this story chronologically. Some things were specific events, such as the first time seeing aurora. Some were "chapters", lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, such as seeing the icebreaker ship approaching and eventually dock. Some things are best written about as they evolved over the entirety of the season, such as how the view from the top of Observation hill changed over a six-month period. And lastly, some things felt more static such as the library.<br><br>
	As such, I intend to catch up on my six months of ice time by writing roughly chronologically – with certain "marker posts" that occur in order as they happened, spaced throughout with things that are a little harder to put on a timeline.<br><br>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fu8UEUt.jpeg" width=90%><br><br></center>
	A couple of things to note: I do not write with the intention of representing the National Science Foundation (NSF), the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), or McMurdo station management as a whole. These writings are of my own experiences and observations as I worked at McMurdo station from October 2023 to April 2024. If anything seems incorrect or unclear, feel free to reach out to me.<br><br>
	Also, <a href="https://brr.fyi">brr.fyi</a> is another excellent Antarctic blog, with more things detailing life at the South Pole over winter, though there are some posts about McMurdo. I highly recommend this blog, and while I hope to not have too much overlap with their posts, it's likely to happen here and there. In any case, I hope to add something new to the conversation when a similar topic is discussed, and I am in no way trying to copy subject matter from that wonderful blog.<br><br>
	With all of that out of the way, I have a fair few number of things to write about – some short, some long – so stay tuned, and thanks for reading!<br><br>

<h2>Observation Hill</h2>
	<h4>October through April</h4>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OIzBgki.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	I'm starting the Antarctic barrage with Observation Hill – a short hike within town that has solid elevation gain and is a great way to stretch your legs. I choose to start with Ob Hill for a few reasons: one, it was something I did my second day on the ice with a few other new folks; two, it is looking to be one of the longer posts from my time on the ice; and three, it was an excellent way to observe changes on station over the course of the season.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IBqx58J.jpeg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Before we go up, I'd like to talk about Ob Hill from town. You can see it from most anywhere in town, all the way from Hut Point (saved for a later post), and while not necessarily imposing it is definitely ever-present. It's a nice marker as you walk around town and a reminder of "home base" when you're out on the ice shelf. Throughout the season, you can see it go from being covered in ice to bare rock and back to snowy.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/c1mhJh1.jpeg" width=38.5%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QUo1url.jpeg" width=51.5%><br>

	As seen from the ice shelf near Long Duration Balloon (LDB) site.<br><br>
	</center>
	Standing at 754 feet tall, it's a sharp increase in elevation and is not a hike to sneeze at as it's less than half a mile long. When it was icy, we had to put traction soles on our boots so as not to slip on our way up or down. In the summertime, it was bare rock and you could do it comfortably in running shoes. The difference in weather was always something to prepare for - when I first ascended it was -40F with wind chill, and gusts up to 30 miles and hour blowing snow and reducing visibility drastically. On the warmest days of 30F to 35F, you could do it in pants and a light sweater.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KNTFpTf.jpg" width=90%><br><br>
	</center>
	Onto the hike itself. I'll be doing side-by-side photos of the first time I ascended as well as what it looked like on a clear day. You start in town, and you needn't worry about filling out an eFoot plan in the summer (saved for a later post), so you could do Ob Hill at any time you wanted. Starting at the Berg Field Center (the blue building in the below photo), you hang a right to start your ascent.<br><br>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WE8nXHf.jpg" width=90%></center><br>
	Going past the fuel storage tanks, you first go past this fuel pipeline (either over or under) and then it's a steep climb with some switchbacks until you reach an access road.<br><br>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QVkELSS.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EkxYBxf.jpeg" width=45%><br>
	Here you can see the difference between spring and summer.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pl1XEvC.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	At the start of the season, this was at shin-height and you could easily step over. By the end, you ducked underneath.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6GjN8lG.jpeg" width=90%><br>A looming start.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JiDRA2S.jpg" width=45%><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XIR6a57.jpg" width=45%><br><br></center>
	As you approach this road, you start to see some field equipment on the ridge. This equipment includes (but is likely not limited to) a weather station and a <a href="https://www.usap.gov/videoclipsandmaps/mcmwebcam.cfm">live webcam of town, which you can view here</a>. This access road will take you back to the main road, or continue onto a flattened area that was once the site of a nuclear reactor.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GhoUTQA.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1S9wNId.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EuGgbFT.jpg" width=70%><br><br></center>
	The reactor has long since been decomissioned and removed, and in its place you can find a plaque detailing its history on the continent. It reads:<br><br>
	<center><font size="2">
	PM-3A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT<br>
	AUTHORIZED AND FUNDED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS AUGUST 1960<br><br>

	The nuclear reactor at McMurdo has an interesting history, of which a very thorough writeup <a href=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph241/reid2/">can be found here on Stanford university's website</a>. While on paper nuclear power on the ice is a great solution to a big problem (transporting fuel, heating, desalinization), this test didn't work. To this day, "science runs on diesel".<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LO3lY3L.jpg" width=90%><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D72NENc.jpg" width=90%><br>
	These platforms are all that remain of the nuclear site.</center><br>
	The remnants of the reactor is roughly one-third of the way up Ob Hill, so let's keep hiking! More switchbacks takes you up, and you begin to see more of town all at once. Eventually, you make your way to a small spot with a little shelf (I evidently don't have a photograph). I'm not sure when this was put here, but it's a good place to stop and is roughly two-thirds of the way up the mountain. When I hiked Ob Hill, I always grabbed a rock from the base of the mountain to take to the top. On my way back down, I'd drop it in this little receptacle.<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Cpchlxu.jpg" width=90%><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OnfR4hG.jpg" width=45%><br>
	</center>
	Continuing up, your steps remain large as it feels the mountain only gets steeper. More careful footfalls are required here, especially when the trail is covered in a sheet of snow and ice. As you start to crest the mountain, you begin to see Scott Base and before you know it, you've reached the top!<br><br>
	<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sOWbcrH.jpg" width=45%>

	</center>
	At the top sits a memorial cross as well as another plaque in four languages - English, French, Spanish, and Russian. In the wintertime, the cross is boxed up to prevent damage from the harsh environment. The plaque, in English, reads:<br><br>
	<center><font size="2">CROSS, OBSERVATION HILL<br>
	THIS CROSS IN AN HISTORIC MONUMENT<br>AND PRESERVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE<br>PROVISIONS OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY.<br>IT WAS ERECTED IN JANUARY 1913 TO<br>COMMEMORATE CAPTAIN SCOTT AND HIS<br>PARTY WHO LOST THEIR LIVES ON THE<br>RETURN JOURNEY FROM THE SOUTH POLE<br>IN MARCH 1912.<br><br></font></center>
	From up here, you get a great view of McMurdo station proper, the continental mountain ranges, Phoenix airfield, Williams airfield, LDB site, Scott Base, Mount Terror, and Mount Erebus. It's truly a great place to observe (ha!) everything in the vicinity.<br><br>

	Mount Erebus, steaming, absolutely dwarfs Castle Rock (the larger peak below the mouth of the volcano).<br><br>

	Zoom in! A C17 Globemaster parked at Phoenix Airfield, which serviced wheeled aircraft.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fxduvWw.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	This photograph looks east-northeast on the ice shelf. See those smudges? That's Long Duration Balloon (LDB), which launches long-term weather balloons holding telescopes, and Williams Airfield, which services ski-aircraft.<br>Each of these sites are about 7 miles off of Ross Island.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XdTUgMt.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	I only had a clearer photo of LDB, but you can see those two taller buildings - that's where the telescopes were assembled.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CKqXraX.jpeg" width=90%><br>
	Looking west, we see White Island. My favourite of the other islands, it always reminded me of Hoth.<br><br>

	The prevailing winds typically came from east-northeast, and at the summit there was a south-west facing nook that blocked nearly all of the incoming wind where you could sit comfortably. Some of my favourite memories on the ice are at the summit of Ob hill, and they include but are not limited to falling asleep for a good 20 minutes, eating an orange in solitude or in good company, seeing the icebreaker come in, drawing the mountain ranges, or watching the sunset.<br><br>

	On our first ascent, with numerous people all bundled up for their first Antarctic excursion, it took us maybe an hour or more to reach the top. Each party member wore so many layers, goggles, gloves, carried hand warmers, water, snacks, the whole enchilada. My waterbottle and pizza snack both froze by the time we summited. By midsummer, when trail conditions were much less icy and things warmed up a bit, I was able to reach the top in about 18 minutes. As I said before, Observation hill is a good all-encompassing story for my season on the ice, as I did it 43 times between mid-October and mid-April.<br><br>

	It was still delicious.<br><br>

	Going up and down so many times really gave me an appreciation for how much things changed over the course of 6 months. The first few times I descended, there were sections where you could sit down and slide for a ways. In the summer, it was all rocky. I saw Ob Hill transform from an icy monolith to a rocky hike, back to a snowy and slightly-icy peak in my time on ice. Below are a number of side-by-side comparisons of Ob Hill, taken at various points throughout the season.<br><br>

	Things also changed drastically when looking around from the top. These changes were especially noticeable as the peak of summer came and the sea ice was broken up the icebreaker. Over time, you could see the initial push, the widening of the ice canal, and the eventual breakup of the thin sea ice as the wind carried it out of the Ross bay. From here you could see how light hitting town changed as the sun first spiraled up into the sky, and then spiraled back down. By the time I left the ice, the sun was behind the mountains around station for all but 45 minutes a day, where you could see it set over the ocean.<br><br>
	Below is a short video of 20 images, aligned to the best of my ability, of McMurdo station changing over the course of six months.<br><br>

	If you were lucky in your timing, you could see planes take off and land at either of the two aforementioned airfields. Before the flight gap at Phoenix airfield, C17 Globemasters would rip through the sky on their way to and from New Zealand. Throughout the year, you could see the New York Air National Guard's LC-130H or Kenn Borek Air's Twin Otters and Baslers come and go from Williams airfield.<br><br>

	I hope you can understand why Ob Hill seemed to be a good lens with which to view change around the station - it was a way to literally step out of town to get a view of everything for a moment.<br><br>

	One last little fun bit about Observation Hill - there was a challenge to climb it 39 times over the course of the season. With an elevation gain of 754 feet, going up 39 times was enough to sum an equivalent elevation gain of 29,406 feet which is greater than that of the height of Mount Everest (29,031 feet). In town, there was a leaderboard to track your ascents, and I completed the challenge on February 14th. The first one to complete the challenge in the 23-24 summer was my good friend Max, who had been doing Ob Hill daily for some time since his arrival in August for Winfly.<br><br>

	The rewards for completing the challenge were bragging rights and a sticker.<br><br>

	And so starts the Antarctic barrage of posts that I've been very late on catching up on for the past several months. There is quite a lot more to write about, but I'm glad I was able to share Observation hill, a special part of my time on the ice, with you all. Thanks for reading, and I'll catch you on the flip flop!<br><br>
