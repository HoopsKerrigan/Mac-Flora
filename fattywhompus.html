	This is the story of a Weddell seal I know named Fattywhompus, and these photos document their journey all the way from the South Pole to my niece in Portland, Oregon. The journey started in February, 2024, and took almost three months from start to finish.

<h2>Fattywhompus - From the South Pole to Portland, Oregon!</h2>

	The journey starts at the geographic south pole – 90°S – the very bottom of the world! For a short while, Fattywhompus was as low on planet earth as you could go. As you can see, the south pole sits above nearly 2 miles of ice – 9,301 feet – and over 800 miles from the ocean.<br><br>

	From there, it wasn't a far journey to the Ceremonial South Pole. This pole is located near the South Pole Station, and is used for ceremonial photos when important people come to visit. The geographic pole is moved about 33 feet every year to account for the fact that the ice shelf is moving! As fun as Fattywhompus had at the pole, they had no plans to stay for winter and wanted to come back north before the last flight out.<br><br>

	Through the help of galley staff, air guard, and firefighters, Fattywhompus was safely flown from the South Pole to McMurdo where they rested up for a bit. They flew on an LC-130H, a big plane staffed by the New York Air National Guard, that takes off and lands on skis. They came through Willy Field, where I was working all summer.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ThVhEGh.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Fattywhompus had fun hanging out with the firefighters, but definitely also enjoyed some rest, relaxation, and recreation after the long trip.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NOPhMbF.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	They spent a lot of time in the McMurdo library, enjoying all of the books that people have donated over the years.<br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OStVOFj.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Being a seal, Fattywhompus wanted to spend some of that time out of town in the fresh air, so they headed to Hut Point. It's here where R. F. Scott built a hut starting in 1901 to use as a home base and hub for future expeditions.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Uw2NbrZ.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2So7cLI.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Before going inside, they took some time to say hello to one of their great-great-grandpas, a mummified seal who has been outside of Discovery Hut for over 100 years!<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/l76mt7y.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oRozJBu.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Here, Fattywhompus shows us how even over 100 years ago, Antarctic workers enjoyed warming up inside with a nice cup of hot cocoa after a long, cold day outside.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X4S8JVV.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oMiM0h5.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Back outside, Fattywhompus caught up with their friends the Emperor Penguins, who were going for a swim in the icy waters just before sunset.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/knALmB1.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GYERKfX.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KCkiBpM.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	On the way back to town, we bumped into one of Fattywhompus' cousins! They were getting big for the long winter months ahead, and enjoying their time on the beach between meals. Walking through town, Fattywhompus wanted to see some of the buildings around station.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xxrO3J4.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	First was 207, a dorm where some of my dear friends lived.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lqZ98W7.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Next was the Science Support Center, a building where lots of construction was happening all season.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4ct3Ri7.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Right across the way was Crary Labs, where a lot of the research projects based in McMurdo were centered. Everything from biology to physics to astronomy to geology happened here!<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CunWHOP.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Not too far away was the ice core facility, where ice several hundred thousands of years old, up to millions of years old, is stored before being carefully transported back to Denver, Colorado.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D12yCtO.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Here Fattywhompus visits the Berg Field Center, or the BFC. This is where all of the field researchers get their gear such as tents, survival bags, extra clothing, and equipment, before they head out to do research for the season. It is one of the coziest buildings on station and a great place to stop for a warm tea.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EW71P41.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	On the other side of town, just past the BFC, Fattywhompus heads up Observation Hill, a short but rewarding hike that gives you a great view of downtown McMurdo at the top.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3bYZWw5.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	In this picture, you can see Mount Erebus, an active volcano, behind Fattywhompus on the left.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zJ4od89.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	And just behind and to the left, you can see a light. That's coming from Scott Base, the New Zealand station, only a couple of miles away!<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DFRDGzi.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6Vx8bQH.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	After all of that time outside, Fattywhompus took some time to warm up with a hot tea and a cookie before dinner at the nicest restaurant south of the Antarctic Circle, Chez Skua.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4ZKvy0X.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gHJGupx.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Before too long, it was time for Fattywhompus to leave McMurdo and fly north. Before doing so, they got to know some of the transport vehicles on station. The most famous of which was Ivan the Terra Bus, who turned 40 years old this past December.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zu9dDJ5.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0s2eWM5.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UQbH0P4.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3nnPLG6.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Ultimately, they took a Delta out to Phoenix Airfield, where flights were coming and going from once Willy Airfield shut down for the season.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qEqIfS1.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D6QtEsT.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	After a couple of landing attempts and some long delays, a New Zealand C130 (without skis), finally landed at Phoenix and took Fattywhompus off of the ice.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X86MkLf.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/m0Hilnq.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SuhK8BX.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	Here they are just after landing in Christchurch, New Zealand!<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dht9aQH.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hX8LHe7.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5epESOD.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	They spent the day in Christchurch enjoying green grass, wildlife, and fresh food before heading to the airport to fly north again.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tl58YX9.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NHXBBSP.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	This time, they flew to Honolulu, Hawai'i, where they had the day to soak in the sun on a sandy beach.<br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IZRkF6c.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/M6LODFG.jpeg" width=100%><br><br>
	But it wasn't too long before they were at the airport again, ready to head to Portland, Oregon, to meet my niece.<br><br>
	That's the story of Fattywhompus, the seal who went from the South Pole to Portland, Oregon.<br><br>
